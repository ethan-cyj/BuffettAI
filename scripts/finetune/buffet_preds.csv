"Businesses that get into the habit of constantly focusing their attention and resources onto showing up in certain ways (like meeting with auditors or doing quarterly earnings reports) can quickly become complacent. They may not be focused on finding new opportunities for growth within themselves or developing strong relationships with other companies they do business with – which is essential to building long-term success. The result could lead them down paths where it’s hard to find high returns elsewhere. Businesses should instead have an eye out for more promising areas that don’t require such constant scrutiny. Business leaders need to keep looking at what will make them better managers in five years than now, rather than just what makes them look good right this minute. It isn’t always easy, but being able to shift your mind frame like this helps you stay ahead of the game over time. People who operate as if everything is important usually come across as entitled; people who operate based on what needs to happen today would never want others around them to worry about tomorrow because they wouldn't know how many hours they're missing. But successful people realize there's nothing wrong with saying ""I'll meet you later."" And most importantly, everyone wants things done correctly so they shouldn’t have any issues thinking anything else"
"I think the best way to get things done is when you work together. I've learned that partnerships can be incredibly powerful and allow people to accomplish more than they could alone. They're also very important for building trust in business relationships and ensuring everyone involved gets what they want out of it. In my opinion, businesses should look at partners as an equal part of their organization just like employees would see them if they worked alongside each other full time. When this happens, there will always be good results from working closely with others. The problem is often how hard we try to keep our partnership separate rather than seeing ourselves as one team. If you have two or three close friends who know exactly where you stand with all your problems then those friendships become great foundations for teamwork – but otherwise not so much! 90%+ of successful companies partner up in some form or another, whether through co-ownership or joint ventures. It’s never been easier to do so now because technology allows us to communicate effectively across distances quickly and easily. There are many benefits including increased visibility, shared culture & success (when you share everything equally). But most importantly having multiple minds thinking about different aspects simultaneously means better solutions to complex problems which gives everyone something positive to achieve -"
"It’s because Berkshire doesn’t pay dividends to shareholders. If it did, the stock price would fluctuate based on whether or not investors bought shares of other companies with higher earnings potential and/or if they were willing to share those gains with shareholders. The owners wouldn’t be able to predict when their cash reserves will run out; in contrast, Buffett can use this information about how much money is available at any given time (and therefore what he should buy) without ever having to sell his holdings to another investor. He also won’t have to worry about competing for investments from competitors who might want to get into business before him. This flexibility allows him to make informed decisions—like buying businesses with high growth rates—without worrying too much about market fluctuations. It’s been said that Berkshire has unlimited resources but limited knowledge. We try our best every day to turn all these thoughts we have into actions. That process takes some discipline. But there isn’t anything else you could do better than Berkshire. I hope many others think similarly! -- Warren Buffett (quoted in “On Investing”, 1965).https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire%E2"
Insurance is an important financial product that helps to manage risks. In order for insurance companies to make money they need to assess the likelihood of future events happening versus their potential costs associated with those events. This assessment is often referred to as “risk” or in this case “insurable interest.” When assessing these factors it’s not just about knowing what will happen – you also have to know how much something might cost if certain things did happen. It has been said that people who think like insurers win when they get into business (https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/30/how-to-be-like-an-insurer_n...). The questioner wants to understand why insuring against fire loss can be more expensive than buying insurance on car accidents where there may be less damage from fires. The answer is because many homeowners don’t want to assume the responsibility to pay for damages caused by wildfires whereas automobile owners typically do so out of necessity due to accident liability laws which require them to cover such losses. You could argue that wildfire coverage should be included under auto insurance policies but I suspect most would agree that having both types makes sense. A company offering life insurance would generally
"The reason for this is that investors often sell when an investment becomes more attractive than others in their portfolio, but with Berkshire's position it will be harder for other companies' stocks to increase in value relative to its own due to Buffett investing so much into the business itself rather than just the price per share or the market cap. It won't cause any major problems, though -- we've seen businesses rise far higher during these kinds of periods because there was no competitor around. The only problem would be if something happened at GEICO (they're now one of our biggest competitors) which affected what was happening elsewhere, such as GM. But that can happen over time anyway. We'll have plenty of opportunities to get rich off some new technology company if I'm running Berkshire -- I don't want to do anything else except run a large farm! -GMB- 2017-06-04T23:58:19Z  2017-06-05T00:27:10Zhttps://buffettfaq.com/questions/how-do-you-investigate-a-businesses-growth-rate-and-whether"
"No. Financial advice is best obtained through investing yourself or your family and reading books like ""The Intelligent Investor"". It's not necessary to hire someone else for this task. However, if you feel that an investment approach isn't working out the way it should be then finding help would be beneficial in getting better results from your own investments. If there’s something wrong with your portfolio due to ignorance of finance rather than skill, it won’t work itself into your mind! You have nothing to lose but time and money spent on bad decisions (and what might happen after). Investing requires discipline and patience – don’t get discouraged when things go awry at first. Be patient and disciplined because good stuff will come along eventually. The key thing is always being careful about where you put your money so long as possible before making any big moves. Don’t rely solely on other people telling you how to invest; learn enough of their techniques and practices themselves over time so they become second nature to you. Good luck! -HGV.A-Blessings upon you all. What type of investors do you think make wise investments? Are you willing to take some risk for potential rewards? If yes, please share details of successful examples in your"
"Investment is not for everyone and should be done with caution. The world of technology is constantly changing, so it's hard to predict where the market will go next or whether specific businesses can recover from downturns. It’s better to understand your risk tolerance and do thorough research before investing. Some people make good money running successful businesses but they don't always run them well either. Investing is about making smart decisions that work over time. Just like you wouldn’t buy a house just because someone else did it right this morning, you shouldn’t put all your eggs into one basket when it comes to investing. There are many different types of investments out there – stocks bonds etc., - each has its own characteristics and risks. You need to think carefully about what type of investment fits best with how much capital you have available and your personal goals. Good luck! Question asked via email on 12/03/17 at 4pm EST (Buffett didn’t answer) based on an interview conducted last year by Charlie Rose. Answer was submitted as text below. We had questions earlier today and we looked forward to reading his response. He gave us plenty to consider. Best wishes to both of you—Jim Rogers and Bob"
"We have two thoughts when thinking about what we consider valuable. One is the intrinsic value of things – whether they bring us joy and happiness or not – then there’s also our external utility in terms of earning money, having friends etc., but I don’t believe that either one should take precedence over the other too much at any given time. We need to make sure both come together fairly if possible. And so it comes down to finding balance between them. When someone asks me how I would weigh up these values on my own life decisions, I usually just say ‘I wouldn't even know’. It's really hard for me because people often try to sell me something without considering all its costs. If everything was cheap enough, why bother doing anything worthwhile? You'd be better off with $500 than $1 million, right? But does 2% mean more worth than 98%? The answer depends on your personal circumstances. Sometimes valuing certain things like this can help guide your decision-making process, though sometimes you'll get caught out by the most obvious prices! In many cases, however, the answers depend as much on intuition as logic - although obviously logic plays an important role here. People who manage their resources wisely will"
"During times of economic downturn, it is essential to be prepared for financial instability. Having an emergency fund can provide peace of mind and allow you to maintain your standard of living even when the economy slows down or goes into recession. Investing in low-risk assets such as bonds and real estate can also help protect against losses during this time. It’s important not to panic; instead focus on having a plan B so that nothing catastrophic happens. Diversification around different asset classes helps mitigate risk and reduces potential downsides from one investment category to another. It might seem counterintuitive but there may come a point where investing becomes more prudent than foolishness. Stocks have historically performed well following periods of high inflation, which will likely occur again at some future date. However, other types of investments should still yield returns above zero throughout any period. This doesn't mean they won't lose value - just like stocks – but losing money now means only taking out 10 cents per dollar earned. A good rule of thumb is “invest wisely enough today to make better decisions tomorrow.” Remember that many people lost their homes due to excessive borrowing and selling too early. The odds were heavily stacked against them, yet most didn’t heed warnings about housing prices increasing faster than income"
"It seems that both companies have been working together for years in an effort to combat life-threatening accidents caused by driver error. They’ve also invested heavily into safety technologies as well. This will be very beneficial over time with advancements being made all the time. It could lead to safer roads overall. I would recommend reading up on it – there are lots of articles about the topic online. One article was put out recently called “The Billion Dollar Business” which had some interesting insights from the Wall Street Journal. There were many examples at work around the world too!https://www.wsj.com/articles/billion-dollar-business-in-driving-cars-1320568974  

I hope you found my answer useful. Please let me know if you need more information. Good luck finding your answers here. If you find anything wrong or any additional questions feel free to ask. Have fun searching for your answers.   And please tell everyone how important safe cars really are. We should all do our best to drive safely. We can influence others when we own vehicles so they become responsible drivers. It just makes sense that we make them aware of what causes problems before those problems happen. It may even result"
"The question of whether the current system is sustainable in terms of profits has been debated for years. One way to look at it would be that we have seen companies grow and expand over time; however, with growth comes costs as well. Therefore, one could argue that corporations will eventually run out of cash or become less profitable due to increasing costs without any net gain. In other words, if you were to invest $10 million today into Coca-Cola, 35 years from now they might only return $60, but then spend the entire amount on new infrastructure rather than reinvesting some portion back into their business. So there’s no guarantee about future profitability – it depends how quickly businesses can adapt to changing conditions. But overall I think long term capital gains taxes should increase because those amounts are so low compared to income earned from working hard (and therefore higher tax rates). Companies shouldn't just get away with paying very little tax while others do more. It's not fair when someone earns twice what another person does but pays half the rate on that money. The government needs to step up its game and make sure everyone contributes equally. If all this tax revenue was spent equitably instead of lining pockets at Wall Street, maybe things wouldn't"
"I have experience working on some high-risk projects that involved junk bonds. I worked for a company called Smith Financial in the 1980s and was exposed to junk bonds there as well. The industry is always volatile, but it can be rewarding if you're able to identify good opportunities early enough. It's not something that many people do successfully, though – those who succeed usually find ways of doing things differently than everyone else does. In hindsight, this could make or break your career! Good luck. -Laughter. You want me to write all about my experiences? How hard would that be??? Well, maybe we should talk about writing books instead. Let’s discuss how bad ideas end up being big successes. For example, Walt Disney had no idea what he wanted to become when he turned 25 years old. He just went around talking to his friends and getting advice from others until someone suggested a business plan for him which led to success. We will only get one chance at life; don't waste it on foolishness.

"I went to the University of California at Berkeley. I studied business administration and economics. It was an incredible experience that changed me in so many ways. The people there were amazing – they cared about what they taught students and how much passion they had for their work. They made learning fun! A good teacher is like a mentor; it’s not just passing information from one generation to another but also inspiring future generations with their own passions. Business management isn't all hard math and tedious paperwork - lots of creativity involved as well. Learning through hands-on experiences helps more than textbooks or online courses do. If you have kids, this might be a great way to give them advice on how to succeed in life. And if your children become entrepreneurs someday, remember what I said above! Great parents always try to instill those values into their children. My dad died when I was 19, before he could see my success story because I won his scholarship while still living with him. But I learned quickly after graduation thanks to some very smart teachers who encouraged me every step of the way. You don’t need a degree to know how to make money; you only need degrees to get yourself killed trying something foolishly wrong. Success doesn’t come easy"
"Good leadership is about having an innate ability to connect with people. Great management requires not only hard skills like business acumen but also soft ones that allow for creativity, empathy, and emotional intelligence. A good leader needs to be able to build trust with others so they can get their vision across clearly - this means being honest at times when it's difficult or empathetic during tough situations. They need to know how to communicate effectively whether its through words or action (or both). Being present in meetings helps; if your presence doesn’t show up then all of the planning isn't helping. Good communication includes clarity without jargon – everyone should understand whats going on regardless of background. The key is finding someone who has those intangible traits which define success. It really comes down to attitude. Leaders have passion, commitment, integrity and love of country/community etc., and these things make them more likely to succeed. People look to leaders because they want something from them rather than just taking orders. You don’t see politicians talking to each other over breakfast, yet we expect our CEOs to talk to us every day! Managers must lead by example. If you're living a life outside of work then employees won't either. When I was working for my dad he"
"A good rule of thumb to determine whether you should invest in something or not is the 80/20 rule. If one thing drives half your income and all else equal (like cost), then it's probably worthwhile to own that business. This also applies to buying homes - even though owning a home may seem like an important commitment, there’s usually another investment opportunity waiting around the corner! Investing has its ups and downs but generally speaking, staying true to your goals will pay off over time. Just don't get discouraged when things go wrong – keep at it and enjoy every step along the way. Remember, most people can only dream about what they'd be able to accomplish with their money someday; take advantage of opportunities right now for more than just short-term gains. Good luck! You'll find your passion once you have enough capital! It happens to everyone sometimes! We're here to help make sure you avoid mistakes. Question from user 1537941682 on Quora.com: What makes someone buy stocks instead of bonds?

"I prioritize liquidity and growth. I want businesses with good balance sheets that can raise capital quickly if needed. And those that have high potential for rapid expansion or lower costs of production should be attractive too. In terms of specific metrics like P/E ratios, I look at them from the perspective of investors versus shareholders – it's important not just how much cash they're generating but also where their earnings per share will grow over time (and whether there is room on the balance sheet). If you understand these key factors then investing becomes very simple. The more complex things get, the harder it gets. Just remember why we do this work; people need to make money so let’s help them find ways to increase returns without going broke themselves! It has been said before “Don't go into a game knowing only one rule.” So when considering investments think about making money as fast as possible while keeping expenses low, regardless of who owns the company. That way even though your friend may lose his shirt, he won’t either. Investing isn’t rocket science and once you grasp some basic principles it doesn’t become complicated at all. All successful companies outperform others based on fundamentals alone, however popular ideas gain traction after being around long enough.. You don"
"One thing that is generally bad for your mind and body. This could be anything from smoking or drinking too much alcohol to having an unhealthy diet. It will lead you down the path of regret in life as well as physical health issues later on. Avoid these things at all costs! If someone told you they wanted to live forever but had never experienced any negative consequences due to their actions, I would tell them not to do it! 02/15/1963 – John Lennon died aged just 48 years old; this was the same age he said he’d become when his wife Ann first got pregnant with his child. He did everything wrong including marrying two times while working full time, buying houses without saving enough etc.. All those mistakes led him up the road to death and heartbreak. The only way out of this cycle is through forgiveness which can happen once we have forgiven ourselves (which may take many lifetimes). We need to forgive others if we want our own lives to go well. Remember what Jesus taught us about love towards others so spread that around! Don’t get caught up in the idea that “it won't happen” because there's no guarantee - some people might try to cheat themselves into feeling better"
"The healthcare system is an enormous cost for society. There’s no question about that – it would be crazy to pretend otherwise. If you were to look at all of those private insurers in one day they could pay out $50 trillion in claims alone, but we don't see any signs of this happening yet; so far nobody has come forward with their cash cow idea. The government will do what ever's necessary if people demand it. I think that once everybody knows how much money is being spent then politicians may have less incentive to throw more around than needed. Some things need to stay private because our elected officials aren’t allowed to know everything going on inside companies like insurance firms or banks.. We want them not to know anything except when there was something wrong.I am also very disappointed with where healthcare spending stands now versus 10 years ago. It seems as though there isn’t enough focus right now on finding better ways to deliver care while keeping prices down. Healthcare reform needs to address both issues simultaneously - reducing costs without cutting quality of care and making sure everyone gets access to medical treatment regardless of financial status (this last part requires big changes).We should invest in new technology and training programs so doctors can communicate more effectively together and use"
"PetroChina is investing in Africa to increase its oil reserves and reduce dependence on OPEC. The country has seen an increase of 15% in crude exports since 2014 and there were talks about exporting more than 3 million barrels per day (b/d). They see this as their best opportunity for increasing profits over time. China’s GDP doubled from $8 trillion in 1970 to $36 trillion last year – they have very large natural resources and could become major producers if they invest enough capital. However, it also means that other countries will be competing with them at prices which may not benefit American consumers anymore. But the people who own most of these assets want to hold Chinese companies like PetroChina rather than those owned by US corporations or foreign governments such as Saudi Arabia or Russia. So you can imagine how many billions of dollars China holds abroad—and what kind of influence they might exert over global economic policies.https://www.businessinsider.com/petrochina-investment-prospects-in-africa-2015-11#:~::https://www.thehuffingtonpost.com/2015/10"
"Anheuser-Busch was acquired for $10 billion after we had sold its beer business to Coca Cola. It has been an interesting ride ever since then - our stock price went from 3 cents per share to over $40 per share and now is below that level due to low demand for Budweiser beers. We didn't have much knowledge about how it would perform until several years ago when we saw the value of the businesses associated with it. But I think we've found something that will work out well even though there's not as big of a following among consumers like they were back in the early days. The people who buy beer are different than those buying Coke products today – what worked during the past few decades isn’t going to work forever. In any case, the company’s management knows this very clearly so you can rest assured that their decisions won’t be influenced at all by short term consumer trends. They know how the market works better than most everyone else. And therefore if you invest your money wisely, you should do okay too!

"There is no consensus on whether EMT or Valuation theory should be taught in college. Some argue that students need to learn about both sides of an argument so they can evaluate information more effectively; others believe it’s best for them to know only one side. It really depends on what kind of student you want to produce. I would recommend teaching something called Value at Risk – it teaches people how to manage risk when making investment decisions. But then again, if someone wants to make money with stocks, they don't care what other people think! What matters most is their own judgment. In fact, I am now going to teach my son how to do this - he will probably not take over the school someday. They say that every teacher has two sons who disagree but never talks about it...I hope mine didn’t tell his first son “you're wrong, go back to India!” The truth is, there isn’t any way for anyone to guarantee perfect decision-making 100% of the time. We have tried everything we could come up with since Adam Smith -- all sorts of things like auctions, etc., etc.. And even though each person makes good rational choices based on limited knowledge, human nature leads us into irrational"
"I would say that one of the greatest successes of Capitalism is how it has enabled humanity to solve problems in fields such as healthcare and education. These industries have not only provided jobs for people but also improved human life overall. In contrast, many other systems like communism or socialism may be more successful at individual levels but less so when compared with Capitalism globally. For example, providing free universal health care might make everyone happy on an individual level but could lead to national economic woes if those costs were passed on to consumers. Therefore I think capitalism holds up well under scrutiny across various domains including business, politics, society etc., because its benefits far outweigh any drawbacks over time. It’s hard to quantify these outcomes though - what does happiness mean anyway? But we can agree that there must be something about capitalism which works out better than others. People generally seem to prefer this system. We don’t see too much social unrest (in terms of government) due to poverty/unemployment; instead most countries just sort of float around until they get into trouble – perhaps their leaders aren’t very effective – and then things go sideways pretty quickly. This doesn’t happen with corporate America where companies need laws & regulations to function effectively and profitably. Businesspeople will"
"It takes passion and dedication. It also requires hard work and perseverance over time. To be successful in anything is not an overnight process but rather a lifelong pursuit of improvement. You have got to want what you’re working for - whether that means being the best at something or helping others. There will always come times when you feel like giving up because things aren't going your way. But if you give yourself permission every day to keep moving forward no matter how small it may seem then eventually there comes a point where all those tiny steps add up into making progress towards whatever goal you set out to do. This can mean different things depending on who you ask so just enjoy each step along the journey. The key thing about success isn't having lots of money – although I would say having plenty makes life easier. It's more important than material possessions or fame – it's really about living with integrity, kindness, love and honesty which translates well into other areas of our lives too. The world needs people we admire as much as people whom we look down upon – they're still human beings after all! We should strive to make this world better and try harder to live good lives ourselves; it doesn't cost us nothing. Some days it feels very difficult while others"
"Geico’s decision to invest in Costco was made for several reasons. First and foremost, it offered an attractive opportunity for growth without requiring significant capital expenditures or operational changes. They would be able to focus their resources more effectively on increasing revenue per share rather than spreading that across multiple businesses like GEICO does. Additionally, they saw potential synergies between the two companies – such as greater economies of scale from having both products sold under one roof. It also looked very much like an acquisition at some point down the road which could lead to further gains through diversification into different categories with lower costs.. There is no doubt there will be opportunities elsewhere within GEICO where those same types of synergies can apply but this partnership makes sense given how close Costco is now to being a full-fledged competitor to GEICO.. The company has done well over time due to its ability to do things differently compared to competitors so I wouldn't rule out them doing something similar if needed. But looking back on history we have seen many successful acquisitions before and never had any trouble predicting when it might happen again - so why not try it here?. In summary, despite initial concerns about higher management fees, overall returns were positive based solely on factors related to business model strength"
"Coca-Cola has historically been affected by international economic conditions such as currency fluctuations or political instability. However, they can mitigate these risks through diversification into new markets. The company's strong brand recognition also helps to shield them from external factors that may impact sales. It depends on one’s perspective – some people see weakness across global economies as an opportunity for companies like Coca-Cola, while others view it as a threat to business performance globally. In any case, Coca-Cola remains committed to its core values—innovation, quality, customer service—and will continue to strive to remain competitive no matter what happens around the world. Over time, this strength should help maintain shareholder value even if global events cause short term price volatility. Some argue that because of its market dominance, a weaker dollar doesn't affect overall profits since Coca-Cola generates more than $40 billion per year outside U.S.-based operations. But, we believe the benefits of being able to reach so many customers worldwide outweigh those drawbacks. We don’t think about how much money could be made overseas, but instead focus on making sure our products appeal everywhere. What matters most in the end isn’t where your factories are located, but whether your product appeals well enough"
"I think about my own behavior. I am a person who tends toward being disciplined. When things get tough or when someone wants me to make an investment decision based on market conditions rather than fundamentals, they’re trying to sell me something – whether it’s gold or stocks or whatever else. It bothers me because if this were true for all investors, we would have seen better results over time, but there was nothing wrong with us doing our job well. That doesn’t mean we should buy everything at fair value; people shouldn’t try to act like their managers. The stock market can change very quickly so one-day prices don’t reflect reality perfectly. We stay out of those situations because they aren't profitable investments unless you're betting against other people's money (i.e., Bernanke). But I won't go into too much detail beyond saying “we just say no.” In terms of maintaining my proper balance between work and life, I've found three rules which help keep them apart: 1) If somebody asks you how long ago you bought something, tell them you haven't yet opened it and then never will - it helps put things back where they belong. 2) Do anything you want outside of work"
"I was in graduate school. I had graduated with an A- grade at a top university before my first semester even started. The only thing that could’ve kept me back would be if there wasn’t room for growth, but fortunately it didn’t happen. It happened because of everything around us – our parents wouldn't allow us to go out after 10 pm or so. But we went anyway, just like everyone else. So basically, all of those factors combined made it possible for me not to disappoint anyone. If every student knew this stuff, maybe more people would work harder. You don’t need a lot of luck; most things require hard work. People want to believe they’re special, when really nobody ever has been. We think about what we did wrong instead of thinking about what we should have done differently. We put ourselves down rather than up. And we compare others much worse than ourselves. It’s almost impossible to succeed without some form of motivation. This will probably sound crazy, but I think we owe it to each other to try to earn a little bit of meritocracy. There shouldn’t be one person who gets two BAs/GAs while another guy does nothing except watch TV during class"
"To change crowds mentality you need leaders who can stand out and set an example. They must be people of integrity because if they have no moral compass it is hard for others not to do what they want to do in order to get away with something. If your leader isn’t good at this then you won’t see results from changing other groups or individuals around you. People follow those that inspire them so even though there may only be one person doing things right – look for evidence elsewhere too. You also need strong motivation to act on these principles but make sure its worth the effort (not just short term gains). Also when talking about ideas try to put yourself into their shoes as much as possible before speaking up. When we speak we should think like they would say something. Lastly don’t forget to talk amongst yourselves first – getting buy-in early helps build momentum over time. Leaders themselves will go through periods where people might lose interest; however once back onto track, keep going! Everyone has moments where they feel overwhelmed, use this opportunity to remind everyone else why it matters. Remember some stuff doesn't matter very often. Make sure you understand how important whatever issue is being talked about. It's easier to stop someone than start someone off down the"
"I would say that the most important thing I've learned is how to handle people. It's amazing what can happen when you're able to build strong relationships with others and earn their trust. You don't have to be perfect; just do better than everyone else in terms of building those connections and showing genuine interest in other people. If you put yourself out there enough times, it really pays off. That being said, having my own opinions isn’t wrong either – but not always right too. Learning from your successes and failures has been invaluable for me over time. And another big one is never judging someone based on who they were 10 years ago. People change and evolve so quickly nowadays. Just because something didn’t work well ten years ago doesn’t mean it won’t work today. Sometimes we get caught up thinking about our past performance versus current circumstances – however much sense this makes! We all learn at different rates and therefore need to focus more on learning together rather than trying to compare ourselves against each other. So yes, I have had many regrets, particularly regarding making bad decisions. But also I think I made good ones as well – like buying houses which turned into problems later down the road (and then selling them)."
"The financial markets have various ways to allocate wealth. For instance, hedge funds often target high-net worth individuals who can afford to lose some or all their capital in pursuit of higher returns; they do not typically invest for long term growth. They may also specialize in investing assets that others would prefer to keep off balance sheets (like tax deferred investments). Some investment houses and asset managers will seek out people with specific skills such as business acumen, etc., and these tend to be seen as being more important than IQs when it comes to picking good businesses. A person’s ability to manage risk is likely much more important than how intelligent you think you are. Wealth distribution has changed over time due to changes in human behavior and technology. In 1930, only a small percentage of households owned stocks – about half. This was partly because so many workers had no pensions at all and were on fixed incomes during retirement years, which led them to buy bonds rather than stocks themselves. By contrast today, virtually everyone owns stock, except those living below poverty level, but most still don’t understand what it means! When I say “wealth,” I am referring mostly to private equity, real estate, options and derivatives, etc., where ownership stakes"
"Asbestos is not considered an environmental hazard. It has been widely used in construction for decades and there hasn't been any significant public health damage caused from it since the 1980s when regulations were put into place to limit its use. Asbestos can be extremely dangerous if you inhale it but that doesn’t mean people should have avoided using it because of some unknown risk factor – just like other hazardous materials we don’t avoid even though they pose risks such as lead or formaldehyde. The regulatory bodies will take action against those who continue to operate with asbestos at high levels without adequate controls. We think this decision was right based on current science about how much exposure causes harm. I would love more regulation around things which could cause long term illness. But let me emphasize again that these types of laws won’t prevent cancer today! They do help protect us now so lets keep them up! (https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/26/asbestos_liability_regulation_revised-statement._html)The American Academy of Environmental Medicine says ""In addition to lung disease, mesothelioma affects other parts of the body including abdominal organs."" So what happens after you get sick?"
"The answer will depend on the specific industry being evaluated. Factors that can influence an industry's attractiveness to investors include its size and growth potential; how it compares with other companies in similar sectors; whether there is strong management or if they have been bought out recently; and where you might be able to buy shares at reasonable prices. Other important considerations may also apply depending upon your goals as well as personal preferences and financial situations. For example, investing in real estate often depends on knowing which types of properties would appeal best to you. Understanding these aspects allows you to make more informed decisions about investments when selecting stocks, bonds, etc., rather than just focusing solely on high returns per dollar invested. The key idea here is not necessarily making quick money but finding something that fits well into your overall portfolio strategy – so take all relevant information into consideration before deciding where to put your capital! What type of businesses do you want to invest in (e.g., technology, healthcare, retail)? How many years ahead do you expect to see them succeed? Are you looking forward toward long-term success versus short term gains? In any case, always consider doing some homework first before diving right in. Investing wisely requires careful thought and diligence over time! Can you tell me more about"
"I like watching movies. I have seen too many to count! I always get so caught up in the story and can't seem to put them down until they're over. My favorite is probably The Godfather – it's just fantastic. I also love reading books about history and science fiction. Sometimes I'll read two or three at once if I'm feeling particularly passionate about one of them. It keeps me occupied for hours! But overall, my favorite things aren’t really specific hobbies, but rather anything that makes you happy and fulfilled. You could be an accomplished writer, musician, artist etc., even though nobody will ever know what you do as long as there are people around who care enough to want to meet you. If you enjoy doing something with others (like writing novels) then this sounds great; however, if you don’t mind being alone all day sometimes - go ahead and pick whatever fulfills you. Your choice. Good luck with everything. 2016 was such a wonderful year... I hope you had some fun while you were young! Enjoy every minute of life, no matter how small! And remember, there will come a time when we won’t need these choices anymore—and only our eyes see us now"
"Yes. The United States is now one of only two countries in human history to have never been defeated militarily – China and India do not currently possess this capability. This could be due to their growing economies, increased global influence, or more advanced technologies. In contrast, the Soviet Union had an enormous military strength but was eventually destroyed. It’s interesting how our perceptions change over time as we look at other nations competing with us on equal footing. Americans today may think they can handle anything because they see themselves as unique compared to others around them; however, it's possible for any nation - even those without large populations like ours - to become powerful if they gain control of natural resources and/or build up significant technological capabilities relative to their competitors' (and hence against their own interests). We've seen what happens when this doesn't happen quickly enough, though. As I mentioned earlier, Russia recently invaded Crimea and tried to take over Ukraine via proxy forces backed by Russian-friendly governments there. They failed miserably and lost big money doing so. But some people still view the world through the lens of ""US vs. USSR"" rather than looking at who else thinks about something differently from them, which seems increasingly unlikely given these recent events. You know"
"I'd advise starting with the basics of investing like understanding stocks and bonds. Learn from others who have done well through patience and discipline. Be prepared for ups and downs in markets. Don't get caught up in fancy ideas or trends; stick to what makes sense financially. And finally don’t be afraid to learn as much as possible about any investment – it's an exciting journey! Good luck!

"Gold has become more valuable in relation to other assets and currencies. For example, the US dollar is stronger than it was 10 years ago as oil prices have risen but not at an exponential rate like that of gold (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/robustness_of_the_dollar/). As long as inflation continues at this pace then we can expect further appreciation for gold. It's also worth noting how much money is being printed every year versus what people want or need – there’s definitely something driving up demand for gold relative to current market conditions. Gold should be considered part of any portfolio with higher-risk exposure. I don't think many investors understand where all these dollars come from! Inflation will cause real returns on investments to fall over time which could lead to some selling pressure on paper currency markets if they aren't managed well enough to keep up. But even when interest rates rise, stock valuations remain so high compared to their historical averages that stocks usually end up underperforming bonds after accounting for inflation. So while I wouldn’t say you own too much gold yet, it would make sense to buy low right now before things get worse. The Fed might print more $4 trillion next month just"
"Yes. I send and receive emails frequently. It’s become an essential tool for communication in the modern world. We don’t have to wait days or even weeks when we need information – it just shows up quickly on our screen! (Laughter) My wife would say that if she had children 20 years ago they wouldn’t be able to do what they can today with their computers. But my daughter has them now, so all is well. If you live at home your kids won't miss you being gone. They'll find other ways of keeping themselves informed. How many times did the CEO mention email during last week's meeting??? The answer was never asked! Laughter. It will continue to grow into an important part of how people communicate; especially those who work from home full-time or travel extensively.. You must read about the evolution of technology over time if you want to understand where things stand today. I like reading stories about early versions of something because there’s always more going on than meets the eye.. Technology evolves fast…and human beings aren’t ready for it yet….I feel sorry for most people right now. People often think that this stuff should take thousands of years to develop but really, as"
"I keep thinking about the future and wondering what will happen in 5 years. It’s always exciting to see how technology has evolved but it can also be stressful as I worry that we won’t have enough resources for everything. My wife is very smart so she knows when things get too tough and comes over with ideas on how to make them better or more efficient without using money. She does this because her father was an engineer who died early in life. We try not to rely heavily on debt. If someone had taken my dad out of retirement today he would probably still work full time if they needed him right now. When people lose their jobs there should be some sort of safety net put into place to prevent further economic hardship. Our society needs to look inward rather than outwards looking for answers from outside our borders (whether government, corporations etc). The world is changing faster than ever before which makes us less capable of doing all kinds of complex tasks alone. People need help figuring stuff out like being able to use credit cards online, pay bills electronically instead of manually. Governments could do something important, such as regulating transactions between companies so no one else loses control. Businesses generally know best about management issues – especially those related to employment contracts - and don’"
"I am motivated to be creative. I believe that art and science go hand in hand. I find inspiration every day from the world around me – nature, history, people’s stories and actions. If I have something that needs improving or creating, then I want to do it myself. In my opinion, there is nothing better than being able to create your own work; it gives you so much freedom! The best part of life is making things for yourself (and others). It can make all the difference between feeling bored at school/work versus feeling fulfilled. There’s no greater satisfaction when someone else appreciates your creation more than you did. Art makes us happy too! I hope this helps explain why I love doing what I do. Thank you very much! You are welcome to visit me anytime to see how amazing everything works together—it does look like magic isn’t it? 😊💜🎨✈️🌟#creativity #art #science #inspiration #success #life #happiness #learning #growth #makingthingforself#beautifyourlives #beautifullife #creativethinkers #creativityisfun #motivation #inspiration #inspiration"
"At Berkshire, we’re very particular about succession. We don’t want anyone to get ahead of us and take advantage of our investment philosophy – so I would not worry too much about succession. It is something that happens all the time in business but it doesn’t make any difference for me as CEO or Chairman. When someone gets up there, they should think “I have no idea what this person will do next.” If you were on my board right now, you wouldn’t be able to predict who would come along and change everything! But if you had read Warren’s book two years ago, you might still understand where he was coming from even though he didn’t finish writing the last chapter yet! The key thing is never put pressure on yourself because people may succeed while you fail; always keep your head down when things go well and try harder when things aren’t going quite so well. And then remember how hard it must have been working those 10-year terms with GEICO. That experience taught you valuable lessons which apply today. Never underestimate the power of patience. Sometimes life throws you curve balls like buying GEICO. Just smile, shake your head slightly back and forth (you can probably"
"I don't know much about specific schools. I'd say look at Berkshire's program or even some online courses from sites like Udemy – there are plenty that might interest you. It really depends on your goals and what you want to learn about investing. I've never had any experience studying under professors but they can be very knowledgeable! The best thing is to find something you're interested in so it will stay with you long after graduation. And always keep learning, as knowledge isn’t going away! Great question. I think every person should do their own research before making big decisions..If you get too caught up in doing things for others rather than for yourself then you won’t enjoy them anymore. You need people who care deeply enough not just to teach you how to earn money but also invest wisely themselves which makes the process more interesting and fun. They have great insights into investment strategies that many other sources may miss. If you love an idea and feel good about knowing everything you could possibly know about it then go for it! Good luck with whatever path you choose. I hope this helps. Let me know if you ever decide to apply for one!  Laughter. In terms of personal finance education - I believe universities offer far"
"Large-cap stocks have historically performed better than smaller cap companies. They may be more stable and less volatile in the long run. This is because they tend to invest their capital on a larger scale with lower debt levels which leads them to earn higher returns per unit of investment compared to other businesses that operate at much lower scales. There's also an inherent advantage for investors who seek out investments with very low correlations – as these markets move up or down together, it makes sense to hold those investments regardless of what happens elsewhere. It doesn't mean one should buy everything you can but rather look into certain sectors where there has been relatively little volatility over time and where your risk tolerance allows this approach. For example, if someone invested $10 million, I would recommend investing about 3% in each category - oil & gas, real estate (especially government), etc., then leave all else aside and just focus on getting back home within two years -- we're not talking about buying houses here! We'd spend our money looking for something that had potential for significant value appreciation versus losses. The key difference between us is how quickly things change relative to human lifespans. We don't want any portfolio sitting around waiting for the universe to go away so fast we'll miss"
"The cheapest way to finance Berkshire is through stock options. Stock options can be issued at an ex-dividend price and then taxed as ordinary income rather than capital gains tax or dividends. The current cost for issuing stock options would be around $10 billion, which may not seem cheap but could provide significant value if done strategically in time. It’s difficult to predict how much this will help us with our future growth prospects – we have no idea what other opportunities might present themselves when the markets adjust. But we wouldn't go crazy trying; they should only get used where there's real opportunity. We like using these instruments because we know exactly who owns them - and that gives us control over their valuation and management decisions. They also don’t depreciate so you won’t see any depreciation effects on the book value unless someone decides to sell shares back into the market..It wasn’t always that way though! In 2004, GEICO had some very interesting things going on – it was trading below intrinsic value (at one point) yet still generating cash from operations…and people were buying lots of junk bond insurance against this illiquid asset class..In my view, having exposure to something this risky doesn"
