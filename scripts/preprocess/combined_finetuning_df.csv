,Question,Answer,Buffett_statement
0, Have you ever bought a company where the numbers told you not to? How much is quantitative and how much is qualitative?,"The best buys have been when the numbers almost tell you not to. Because then you feel so strongly about the product. And not just the fact you are getting a used cigar butt cheap. Then it is compelling. I owned a windmill company at one time. Windmills are cigar butts, believe me. I bought it very cheap, I bought it at a third of working capital. And we made money out of it, but there is no repetitive money to be made on it. There is a one-time profit in something like that. And it is just not the thing to be doing. I went through that phase. I bought streetcar companies and all kinds of things. In terms of the qualitative, I probably understand the qualitative the moment I get the phone call. Almost every business we have bought has taken five or ten minutes in terms of analysis. We bought two businesses this year.General Re is a $18 billion deal. I have never been to their home office. I hope it is there. (Laughter) “There could be a few guys there saying what numbers should we send Buffett this month?” I could see them going once a month and saying we have $20 billion in the bank instead of $18 billion. I have never been there.Before I bought Executive Jet, which is fractional ownership of jets, before I bought it, I had never been there. I bought my family a quarter interest in the program three years earlier. And I have seen the service and it seems to develop well. And I got the numbers. But if you don’t know enough to know about the business instantly, you won’t know enough in a month or in two months. You have to have sort of the background of understanding and knowing what you do or don’t understand. That is the key. It is defining your circle of competence.Everybody has got a different circle of competence. The important thing is not how big the circle is, the important thing is the size of the circle; the important thing is staying inside the circle. And if that circle only has 30 companies in it out of 1000s on the big board, as long as you know which 30 they are, you will be OK. And you should know those businesses well enough so you don’t need to read lots of work. Now I did a lot of work in the earlier years just getting familiar with businesses and the way I would do that is use what Phil Fisher would call, the “Scuttlebutt Approach.” I would go out and talk to customers, suppliers, and maybe ex-employees in some cases. Everybody. Everytime I was interested in an industry, say it was coal, I would go around and see every coal company. I would ask every CEO, “If you could only buy stock in one coal company that was not your own, which one would it be and why? You piece those things together, you learn about the business after awhile.Funny, you get very similar answers as long as you ask about competitors. If you had a silver bullet and you could put it through the head of one competitor, which competitor and why? You will find who the best guy is in the industry. So there are a lot of things you can learn about a business. I have done that in the past on the business I felt I could understand so I don’t have to do that anymore. The nice thing about investing is that you don’t have to learn anything new. You can do it if you want to, but if you learn Wrigley’s chewing gum forty years ago, you still understand Wrigley’s chewing gum. There are not a lot of great insights to get of the sort as you go along. So you do get a database in your head.I had a guy, Frank Rooney, who ran Melville for many years; his father-in-law died and had owned H.H. Brown, a shoe company. And he put it up with Goldman Sachs. But he was playing golf with a friend of mine here in Florida and he mentioned it to this friend, so my friend said “Why don’t you call Warren?” He called me after the match and in five minutes I basically had a deal.But I knew Frank, and I knew the business. I sort of knew the basic economics of the shoe business, so I could buy it. Quantitatively, I have to decide what the price is. But, you know, that is either yes or no. I don’t fool a lot around with negotiations. If they name a price that makes sense to me, I buy it. If they don’t, I was happy the day before, so I will be happy the day after without owning it.",1
1, What is it that really piques your interest in a stock? What tells you that it could be interesting?,"We're so limited now because we can only go into very big companies. Charlie and I are probably familiar with every company in the United States--in a general way--that we can have the kind of position we would need to have to make a difference in Berkshire Hathaway's performance. We look for the ones where we think we know what they're going to look like in 10 years. If the price gets attractive and we know a little about the management, and we're quite sure--within a range--what they're going to look like in 10 years, we're in our area. We buy them when the prices are right, like Coca-Cola was some years back.",1
2, What is your investment process?,"We have a lot of cash because we don’t like any of those fields at the moment. Trying to prioritize among things we’re unlikely to do is pretty fruitless.---------------------------------------------------Q - How do you get better at valuing companies?. Very very good question. I started out not knowing anything about valuing companies. Ben Graham taught me a way to value certain type of business, but the selection of available companies dried up. Charlie taught me about durable competitive advantage. Not how big circle of competence is, but knowing where the edges are is most important. Think about businesses in your own home town. Ask questions about the businesses. Which do you want to buy into, which are hard to compete with, talk about businesses with people. What is working, what is not? You have to ask. You would be surprised at how many companies I know nothing about. The goal is to find companies that will be around for 20 years and offer a margin of safety. You have to recognize your limitations to be successful in this business. 6-7yrs ago I looked at Korean stocks, and I could see a number of businesses that met margin of safety. I bought 20 and diversified. Obviously if you want to get good at something which is competitive, you have to think about it and practice a lot. You have to keep learning because world keeps changing and competitors keep learning. You have to go to bed wiser than you got up. As you try to master what you are trying to do – people who do that almost never fail utterly. Very few have ever failed with that approach. You may rise slowly, but you are sure to rise. When did you start valuing businesses?. I never took a business class, except accounting. When I was a boy, there was a man who came to the club every day at 10:30am. I asked my dad about him – he had such a good life! My Dad said, “He gathers up and renders dead horses.” I learned from that. Many businesses are sold under distress. Life is hard to get near top, and hard to hold position once attained. I think you could predict that Kiewits would win, they cared more. I would not have bet on anyone else. Half Dutch half German – and that is coming from me, I’m named Munger. I was automatically doing it – what was working and what wasn’t. If you have that temperament, you will gradually learn. If you don’t have that temperament, I can’t help you.  We have a lot of cash because we don’t like any of those fields at the moment. Trying to prioritize among things we’re unlikely to do is pretty fruitless.---------------------------------------------------Q - How do you get better at valuing companies?. Very very good question.

3, What is your investment process?,"  In the past some things were cheap enough WB could decide in a day (this was somewhat a function of a time period where companies would sell at 2-3x earnings)*   Decisions should be obvious to onlookers. You should be able to explain why you bought something in a paragraph.*   “I don’t do DCF” (WB says he does a rough approximation in his mind)*   Finding ideas is a function of cumulative knowledge over time. Something just comes along - usually an event takes place, like a good management team screwing up that creates the opportunity (WB seems to imply here that his reading isn’t specifically targeted at finding ideas, but rather that ideas jump out at him as a natural consequence of vociferous reading)*   You must be patient.good ideas tend to be clustered together, and may not come at even time intervals.when you don’t find anything for a while it can be irritating*   WB isn’t bothered by missing something outside his circle of competence - Missing things inside the circle is nerve racking.examples include WMT, FNM--------------------------------------------------When asked about the relative attractiveness of bonds, arbitrage, etc., Buffett replied:Charlie and I are competent to make judgments on certain things, and not other things. We try to focus on what we can understand, which is a reasonable amount.In the summer to mid-fall of 2002, when junk bonds became very attractive, we bought a lot. But we did not make a big decision to buy junk bonds – it’s just that a lot of them got really cheap.We have an open mind – whatever we see on a given day that overcomes our resistance to take risk, we’ll do. Charlie and I do not have a checklist to prioritize categories. I hope he gets a good idea, he hopes I have one and if we find one, then we move, hopefully in a big way. It has to be big.We’re recently made big investments in currencies and viatical settlements. We don’t do arbitrage any more because we’re too big.. Avoiding the dumb things is the most important. Learn more, know limitations, avoid the dumb things. Charlie often thought about his client’s business. He was incapable of thinking about a business without noticing the fundamental economics. I had a client who sold a Caterpillar dealership business for a crazy price to an oil business. The oil business had consultants and a concept and a strategy!",1
4, What's your acquisition criteria?

5, What's your acquisition criteria? What has made you successful in this area where most others have failed?,"We look for people who have a passion for their business. We frequently buy businesses the owners still manage, where they are monetizing a lifetime of work. They often don’t want to sell but need to for estate planning or other reasons.They need to have a passion because we don’t have any employment contracts – because we don’t think they work – we don’t stand over them with whips, and they’re already rich. We just try not to kill or dampen their love for their business.We also look for three things: intelligence, energy and integrity. If you don’t have the latter, then you should hope they don’t have the first two either. If someone doesn’t have integrity, then you want them to be dumb and lazy. (Laughter)We look them in the eyes and ask, “Do they love the business or the money?” If someone wants to cash out, then we have a problem because we only have 16 people at Berkshire’s headquarters and can’t run it ourselves. The interesting thing is how well it our acquisition strategy/process has worked over a great many decades, and how few people copy it. (Laughter)We criticize it acquisitions, but then we do it. But we have different motivations.We’ve been reasonably successful in having people run their businesses with the same passion as before we bought them.Gillette, the oil companies, etc. all went out and bought a lot of businesses and tried to run them themselves. We’re under no illusions that we can do that. We think that having lots of Executive Vice Presidents, directives from headquarters, centralized Human Resources etc. can destroy the incentives of the people who’ve already gotten rich, and we’re counting on them making us rich.The successor to me will come from Berkshire, knows our system, has seen that it works, and will be surrounded by people who believe in it. So it’s not going to be so hard to keep this train going down the tracks at 90 miles per hour.We are a conglomerate – and we hope to become more of a conglomerate.We’re successful because of simplicity itself: We let people who play the game very well keep doing it. Our successor won’t change this. The big worry is that the culture is tampered with and there’s oversteering. But our board and owners won’t allow this.---------------------------------------------------BRK2006 - Update on acquistionsRussell is in process – it’ll probably be a couple of months before completion. I described the Business Wire acquisition in the annual report. I got a letter from Cathy Baron Tamraz, CEO of Business Wire. Regarding the purchase of GE’s Medical Protective Corporation, I knew GE CEO Jeff Immelt wanted to shed some insurance assets and I suggested we’d be interested in that part of it, so we talked and made a deal.One thing we haven’t done is participate in auctions. I get books occasionally and the projections are just plain silly. Maybe that’s why they don’t sign them. I’d love to make a bet with the investment bankers about whether the companies achieve the earnings in the pitch books.The calls we want to get are from people who care about their business, who for tax or family-ownership reasons want to sell to us. They’re looking to change the ownership structure, not the operating personality and culture of the company they care deeply about.The owners of Iscar are keeping 19% I think he meant 20%. They think Berkshire is the best place for their business and their people, and where they’ll have the most opportunity to grow. I don’t know how many stories you read about a $4 billion deal that doesn’t say anything about an investment banker on either side.By charging fees, fees, fees. LaughterA shareholder asked if he’d be interested in buying Oriental Trading Company, a direct marketer of novelties and gift items, which is based in Omaha. I looked at Oriental Trading a few years ago. I didn’t know it was for sale again. I don’t know, but I suspect some private group bought it and is now selling it. We see that all the time. They invariably try to sell it quickly to a strategic buyer, which is another way of saying someone who pays too much. Anytime someone calls me and says we’d be a logical strategic buyer, I hang up the phone faster than Charlie would.The idea that we’re going to find a business to buy from a guy who’s been thinking from the moment he bought only about how he’s going to spruce it up and get out, is very low. It’s Fund A selling to Fund B to Fund C. The irony is that the same pension fund may be invested in all three funds, so they’re just paying all of the money managers to flip it to one another.",1
6, What's your acquisition strategy? How do you get deals?,I can’t remember one,0
7, What's your acquisition strategy? How do you get deals?,"We'd like to keep buying businesses like the eight we bought last year. Our first preference has always been to buy outstanding operating businesses outright. We've made money in stocks, especially in the 1970s, but the climate is not so favorable now.There are enough businesses that meet our criteria to do two acquisitions per year on average. What we'd really like to do is a $10-15 billion acquisition, but it's hard to find one that's not being auctioned, which we don't do.We haven't had much luck buying businesses overseas, but that's because our phone hasn't rung. We're not on the radar screen, but we're hoping this will change.Our best source of deals is word of mouth, generally in industries we're invested in. Sort of like NetJets, where 70% of our new customers are referred by current customers.---------------------------------------------------It’s important to note that in this world where many businesses get dressed up and auctioned off, we occasionally hear from people who consider their business too important to auction off. We don’t participate in auctions. I can’t recall buying a business at auction, can you Charlie?People who won’t put their business up for auction like a piece of meat and care about the home in which their business resides are the type of people we want to be partners with. It says something very important about how much they care about their business, their customers and their employees. We’ve acquired a number of businesses like this in the past couple of years and the crowning one is Iscar. I’m going to Israel in September to see if there are any more girls like Iscar there.Tilson Notes - I think the Iscar acquisition is fantastic news for three reasons:*   1. It’s big – at $4 billion, it’s the 3rd-largest deal Buffett has ever done);*   2. It appears to be an awesome business. According to an article in an Israeli newspaper, Iscar was valued at $800 million in 1997, so it’s increased in value by more than 6x in nine years (that’s 22.6% compounded annually); and*   3. It’s the first business Buffett’s ever bought that is headquartered overseas. This is a huge step forward in expanding his hunting ground to the entire world for the “elephants” he’s seeking. Having lived and traveled all over the world, I know that there are many fabulous, privately held businesses like Iscar, and Berkshire is the perfect buyer for many of them.",1

9, Deal Flow?,"We don't like the term ""deal flow"" because we don't view them businesses we might buy as deals. We look at deals a few times a year. In the US, we get a pretty reasonable percentage of the calls we should get. We didn't get those calls 20-40 years ago because we weren't as well known.It feeds on itself. If we acquire companies and people say good things, we'll hear from more. We acquired one furniture company, which led to four more.It's like a snowball. By being around 38 years, it's been a high mountain and Berkshire is now a big snowball and attracts a lot of snow.Outside the US, we don't see many deals because we're not as well known.I don't hear about one deal a week or even a month. But most we want to hear about, we get a good percentage of the calls. It would be a plus if we were to see more deals outside this country.We didn't have the money to do many deals. When we bought National Indemnity, it was a big deal for us. We hope there's a lot of mountain left and a lot of wet snow.",1
10, What sources of investment ideas are available today?,"First, you need two piles. You have to segregate businesses you can understand and reasonably predict from those you don't understand and can't reasonably predict. An example is chewing gum versus software. You also have to recognize what you can and cannot know. Put everything you can't understand or that is difficult to predict in one pile. That is the too-hard pile. Once you know the other pile, then it's important to read a lot, learn about the industries, get background information, etc. on the companies in those piles. Read a lot of 10Ks and Qs, etc. Read about the competitors. I don't want to know the price of the stock prior to my analysis. I want to do the work and estimate a value for the stock and then compare that to the current offering price. If I know the price in advance it may influence my analysis. We're getting ready to make a $5 billion investment and this was the process I used.",1

Laughter. You want to read a lot of financial publications. The New York Times has a much better business section than it had 25 years ago. Read Fortune.I don't read any analyst reports.

15, Is there an organizational model that allows you to deal with all the information?,"The beauty of valuing large companies is that it is cumulative. If you started doing it 40 or so years ago, you've really got a working knowledge of an awful lot of businesses. There aren't that many, to start with. What are there, 75 or so important industries? You get to understand how they all operate, and you don't have to start over again every day, and you don't have to consult a computer or anything like that. So, it has the advantage of the accumulation of useful information over time. Why did we decide to buy Coca-Cola in 1988? Well, it may have been because of a couple of small, incremental bits of information, but that came into a mass that had been accumulated over decades. That's why we like businesses that don't change very much.",1

17, Do you have advice for the individual investor to help them narrow the stock universe?,"They ought to think about what he or she understands. Let's just say they were going to put their whole family's net worth in a single business. Would that be a business they would consider? Or would they say, ""Gee, I don't know enough about that business to go into it?"" If so, they should go on to something else. It's buying a piece of a business. If they were going to buy into a local service station or convenience store, what would they think about? They would think about the competition, the competitive position both of the industry and the specific location, the person they have running it and all that. There are all kinds of businesses that Charlie and I don't understand, but that doesn't cause us to stay up at night. It just means we go on to the next one, and that's what the individual investor should do._So if they're walking through the mall and they see a store they like, or if they happen to like Nike shoes for example, these would be great places to start? Instead of doing a computer screen and narrowing it down?_A computer screen doesn't tell you anything. It might tell you about P/Es or something like that, but in the end you have to understand the business. If there are certain businesses in that mall they think they understand and they're public companies, and they can learn more and more about them. We used to talk to competitors.

18, What advice would you give to new investors?,"Sandy Gottesman, a Berkshire director, runs a large, successful investment firm. Notice his employment practices.

Charlie and I have made money in a lot of different ways, some of which we didn’t anticipate 30-40 years ago. You can’t have a defined roadmap, but you can have a reservoir of thinking, looking at markets in different places, different securities, etc. The key is that we knew what we didn’t know. We just kept looking. We knew during the Long Term Capital Management crisis that there would be a lot of opportunities, so we just had to read and think eight to ten hours a day.

19, What advice would you give to new investors?,"I think you should read everything you can. In my case, by the age of 10, I’d read every book in the Omaha public library about investing, some twice. You need to fill your mind with various competing thoughts and decide which make sense. Then you have to jump in the water – take a small amount of money and do it yourself. Investing on paper is like reading a romance novel vs. doing something else. Laughter You’ll soon find out whether you like it. The earlier you start, the better.At age 19, I read a book The Intelligent Investor and what I’m doing today, at age 76, is running things through the same thought process I learned from the book I read at 19.I remain big on reading everything in sight. And when you get the opportunity to meet someone like Lorimer Davidson, as I did, jump at it. I probably learned more in that four hours than in almost any course in college or business school. You should do well in games with few other players. The RTC Resolution Trust Corporation was a great example of a chance to make a lot of money. Here was a seller government bureaucrats with hundreds of billions of dollars of real estate and no money in the game, who wanted to wrap up quickly, while many buyers had no money and had been burned.There won’t be any scarcity of opportunity in your life, although there will be times when you feel that way.-----------------------------------------------------*   Don’t worry too much about your mistakes*   Don’t learn too much from your mistakes:    *   Don’t become Mark Twain’s cat that never sat again on a stove after being burned    *   BUT.never be willing to play a “fatal” game*   Don’t confuse social progress with the chance to make money – look at airlines and autos for examples*   Law degree is not essential, but good if you think it will help in your specific career*   Learning to think like a lawyer is a valuable trait*   Allocate even more of your day to reading than he does*   Read lots of K’s and Q’s – there are no good substitutes for these - Read every page*   Ask business managers the following question: “If you could buy the stock of one of your competitors, which one would you buy? If you could short, which one would you short?”*   Always read source (primary) data rather than secondary data*   If you are interested in one company, get reports for competitors. “You must act like you are actually going into that business, and if you were, you’d want to know what your competitors were doing.”---------------------------------------------------Re: Ongoing LearningI haven’t been continually learning the basic principles of sound investing, which are still Ben Graham’s. They were affected in a significant way by Charlie and Phil Fisher in terms of looking at better businesses. And I’ve learned more about how businesses operate over time.You need an intellectual framework, which you can get mostly from The Intelligent Investor. Then, think about businesses you can get your mind around if you really work at it. Then, you will do well if you have the right temperament.. I’ve watched Warren for decades. Warren has learned a lot. He can pooh pooh investing in PetroChina, but he’s learned, which has allowed him to expand his circle of competence so he could invest in something like PetroChina.If you don’t keep learning, other people will pass you by.Temperament alone won’t do it – you need a lot of curiosity for a long, long time.---------------------------------------------------It’s hard for individual investors to successfully pick stocks or time the market. The best investment you can make is in your own abilities. Anything you can do to develop your own abilities or business is likely to be more productive than investing in foreign currencies.If you own your own business in America and you run it well, you’ll do OK.When I was seven years old, I first took an interest in stocks. My dad was in the business, so I’d go with him to the office and I saw interesting things. When I was a little older, I went to the library and read every book on markets and investing.When I was 11, I bought my first stock – three shares. I was following charts. When I was 19, I read The Intelligent Investor and it changed my whole framework.My advice is to read a lot. There are no secrets in the business that only the priesthood knows. It’s all right there.It requires qualities of temperament way more than qualities of intellect.Once you have a 125 IQ, much more doesn’t matter. Look for opportunities that fit your framework. Try to learn every day, but you can’t act every day. It’s important to enjoy the game, just as it is to enjoy bridge or baseball if you’re going to play those games seriously.---------------------------------------------------Ben Graham said you’re neither right nor wrong if you’re investing with the crowd – you’re right if your facts and reasoning are right. Once you have the facts, _you_ have to think about what they mean. You don’t take a survey.You should focus on what’s important and knowable. There are many things that are important but now knowable, like whether there will be a nuclear attack tomorrow. You can’t focus on those.As Ben Graham said in chapter 8 of The Intelligent Investor: The market is there to serve you, not instruct you. If it does something silly, it gives you a chance to do something. It just sets prices. If it doesn’t give you an opportunity, go play bridge and come back the next day. And the nice thing is that the prices will be different.During the Long-Term Capital Management crisis, we were getting calls on Sunday from people. By the way, you can make a lot of money on calls on Sunday – that means things are really screwed up. Just make sure you’re the callee and not the caller.At that time, there was an unprecedented 30 basis point spread between on- versus off-the-run 30-year Treasuries. All you have to do in such situations is make sure you can play out your hand under all circumstances. If you can and you have the right facts – and you let the market serve rather than instruct you – you can’t miss. I’d say some of you probably can miss. Laughter",1

21, Where is a good place for new investors to invest right now?,"That’s very difficult - we don’t have one-line advice on that. Maybe for a small investor, continuous investment in index funds might work - but not for us. I like the businesses we’re in, so I wouldn’t be giving up any of my businesses.Investors have to remember: corporate profits are going up, but stocks are going up faster. How can that continue indefinitely? Investors can only earn what companies themselves can earn; the government or the markets themselves don’t kick anything in. How can you get anything more out of a farm than what it grows?There’s nothing magical added by the stock market to corporate returns. It just doesn’t create more earnings to pay out to investors. If you trace out the mathematics of the market’s logic, you begin to see the limits to the logic.---------------------------------------------------We think we’re in a pretty good group of businesses for the world we face. We don’t know which will be super-winners, but we think a significant number will do okay. We don’t buy businesses with much thought of world trends, but we do think about businesses subject to foreign competition, with high labor content and a product that can be shipped in.I bought into an airline US Air with high seat-mile costs of 12 cents. It was protected, but that was before Southwest showed up with 8-cent costs.The variables you name don’t bother us. We have good businesses, deal from strength, always have a loaded gun and have the right managers and people and an owner-oriented culture. We learned about foreign labor competition in our shoe business. It reminds me of Will Rogers, who said he didn’t think man should have to learn easy lessons in such a hard fashion. You should be able to learn not to pee on an electrified fence without actually trying it. Laughter",1
22, What advice would you give to non-professional investors?,"  If you like spending 6-8 hours per week working on investments, do it*   If you don’t, then dollar cost average into index funds. This accomplishes diversification across assets and time, two very important things.*   “There is nothing wrong with a ‘know nothing’ investor who realizes it. The problem is when you are a ‘know nothing’ investor but you think you know something.” NOTE: this is analogous to the concept of ‘metaknowledge’ that Mauboussin talked about.there’s also a Confucius quote on this",1
23, Are investors more or less knowledgeable today compared to ten years ago?,"There is no doubt that there are far more “investment professionals” and way more IQ in the field, as it didn't use to look that promising. Investment data are available more conveniently and faster today. But the behavior of investors will not be more intelligent than in the past, despite all this. How people react will not change – their psychological makeup stays constant. You need to divorce your mind from the crowd. The herd mentality causes all these IQ's to become paralyzed. I don't think investors are now acting more intelligently, despite the intelligence. Smart doesn't always equal rational. To be a successful investor you must divorce yourself from the fears and greed of the people around you, although it is almost impossible.Do you think Ponzi was crazy? The tech and telecom madness that existed just 6 years ago is right up there with the craziest mania's that have ever happened. Huge training in capital management didn't help.Take Long Term Capital Management. They had 100's of millions of their own money, and had all of that experience. The list included Nobel Prize winners. They probably had the highest IQ of any 100 people working together in the country, yet the place still blew up. It went to zero in a matter of days. How can people who are rich and no longer need more money do such foolish things?",1

26," If you were today 20-something years old would you primarily be searching for: a) Situations reminiscent of 1957 – akin to Daehan Flour Mills, or b) Situations reminiscent of 1987 – akin to Moody’s Corporation?","Either is fine. a) is better for small sums. b) is better for large sums_Mr. Buffett, on June 23, 1999 you shared with Business Week:If I was running $1 million today, or $10 million for that matter, I'd be fully invested. Anyone who says that size does not hurt investment performance is selling. The highest rates of return I've ever achieved were in the 1950s. I killed the Dow. You ought to see the numbers. But I was investing peanuts then. It's a huge structural advantage not to have a lot of money. I think I could make you 50% a year on $1 million. No, I know I could. I guarantee that.At a talk to Columbia students in 1993 you shared:When I got out of Columbia the first place I went to work was a five-person brokerage firm with operations in Omaha. It subscribed to Moody's industrial manual, banks and finance manual and public utilities manual. I went through all those page by page.I found a little company called Genesee Valley Gas near Rochester. It had 22,000 shares out. It was a public utility that was earning about $5 per share, and the nice thing about it was you could buy it at $5 per share.I found Western Insurance in Fort Scott, Kansas. The price range in Moody's financial manual.was $12-$20. Earnings were $16 a share. I ran an ad in the Fort Scott paper to buy that stock.I found the Union Street Railway, in New Bedford, a bus company. At that time it was selling at about $45 and, as I remember, had $120 a share in cash and no liabilities.Along similar lines, in late 2005 I understand you explained to a group of Harvard students the following:Citicorp sent a manual on Korean stocks. Within 5 or 6 hours, twenty stocks selling at 2 or 3x earnings with strong balance sheets were identified. Korea rebuilt itself in a big way post 1998. Companies overbuilt their balance sheets – including Daehan Flour Mill with 15,000 won/year earning power and selling at “2 and change” times earnings. The strategy was to buy the securities of twenty companies thereby spreading the risk that some of the companies will be run by crooks. $100 million was quickly put to work.The “1987” Fisher Approach -The following excerpts from an article written by Carol Loomis published on April 11, 1988 in Fortune provide interesting clarity on the modus-operandi of Berkshire circa 1987:Unusual Profitability (High ROE with Low Debt; i.e. high ROIC) - …But in his 1987 annual report, Buffett the businessman comes out of the closet to point out just how good these enterprises and their managers are. Had the Sainted Seven operated as a single business in 1987, he says, they would have employed $175 million in equity capital, paid only a net $2 million in interest, and earned, after taxes, $100 million. That's a return on equity of 57%, and it is exceptional. As Buffett says, ''You'll seldom see such a percentage anywhere, let alone at large, diversified companies with nominal leverage.''Unusual Growth (Opportunities for Reinvestment of Retained Earnings) - …Some folks of the right sort, by the name of Heldman, read that ad and brought him their uniform business, Fechheimer, in 1986. The business had only about $6 million in profits, which is an operation smaller than Buffett thinks ideal. …A few hundred miles away at Fechheimer ( …1987 sales: $75 million)Paying for Quality - …By 1972, Blue Chip Stamps, a Berkshire affiliate that has since been merged into the parent, was paying three times book value to buy See's Candies, and the good-business era was launched. ''I have been shaped tremendously by Charlie,'' says Buffett. ''Boy, if I had listened only to Ben, would I ever be a lot poorer._",1

28, What's your opinion of cigar butts vs quality businesses?,"Ira Marshall said you guys are crazy -- there are some things you should pay up for, like quality businesses and people. You are underestimating quality. We listened to the criticism and changed our mind. This is a good lesson for anyone: the ability to take criticism constructively and learn from it. If you take the indirect lessons we learned from See's, you could say Berkshire was built on constructive criticism. Now we don't want any more today. LaughterThe qualitative evaluating management, competitive advantage, etc. is harder to teach and understand, so why not just focus on the quantitative e.g., cigar butt investing? Charlie emphasized quality of a business much more than I did initially. He had a different background.It makes more sense to buy a wonderful business at a fair price. We've changed over the years in this direction. It's not hard to watch businesses over 50 years and learn where the big money can be made.Even when you get a new important idea, the old ideas are still there. There wasn't a strong line of demarcation when we moved from cigar butts to wonderful businesses. But over time, we moved.",1

30," If you were starting out today, what would you do the same or differently?","We started out this snowball at the top of a very long hill. My advice is either start very early or live very long. I guess I’d do it the same way: maybe I’d start with small companies and buy good businesses. Or little pieces of ‘em called stocks.---------------------------------------------------If we were to do it over again, we’d do it pretty much the same way. The world hasn’t changed that much. We’d read everything in sight about businesses and industries we think we’d understand. And, working with far less capital, our investment universe would be far broader than it is currently.There’s nothing different, in my view, about analyzing securities today vs. 50 years ago.---------------------------------------------------We formed our first partnership 50 years and two days ago, on May 4, 1956, with $105,000. If we were starting again, Charlie would say we shouldn’t be doing this, but if we were, we’d be investing in securities around the world. Charlie would say we couldn’t find 20, but we don’t need 20 – we only need a few that can pay off very big. We’d also be buying stocks in smaller companies.If we were planning to buy entire businesses, we’d have a tough time. We’d have no reputation and only $1 million.Charlie started out in real-estate development because with only a little capital, brain power and energy, you could magnify the returns in real estate unlike in other sectors.I’d just do it one foot in front of the other over time. But the basic principles wouldn’t be different. If I’d been running a little partnership three years ago, I’d have started out 100% in Korea. If I were working with small sums of money, it would open up thousands of possibilities. We have found very mispriced bonds. We found them in Korea a few years ago. You could make big returns but had to be of small size. I wouldn’t be in currencies with a small amount of money. I had a friend who used to buy tax liens. I’d look in small stocks or specialized bonds. Wouldn’t you say that, Charlie?. Sure.----------------------------------------------------Q - If you were starting a $26 million fund, what would you do differently with a smaller asset base? How many positions would you hold, and what kind of turnover would you have? What would you do if some investments lost 50% and some gained?. We would hold the half-dozen stocks we liked best. We would do the same thing if they lost 50%. Cost has nothing to do with it. We look at price and think about what something is worth. Keep it in the few you know. He Buffett has tactfully suggested you adopt a different way of thinking. laughterComment: As Buffett stated, cost basis has nothing to do with investment judgment (apart from tax considerations). Nevertheless, many investors (like the questioner) pay way too much attention to what they’ve paid, rather than its value.",1
31," According to a business week report published in 1999, you were quoted as saying “it's a huge structural advantage not to have a lot of money. I think I could make you 50% a year on $1 million. No, I know I could. I guarantee that.” First, would you say the same thing today? Second, since that statement infers that you would invest in smaller companies, other than investing in small-caps, what else would you do differently?","Yes, I would still say the same thing today. In fact, we are still earning those types of returns on some of our smaller investments. The best decade was the 1950s; I was earning 50% plus returns with small amounts of capital. I could do the same thing today with smaller amounts. It would perhaps even be easier to make that much money in today's environment because information is easier to access.You have to turn over a lot of rocks to find those little anomalies. You have to find the companies that are off the map - way off the map. You may find local companies that have nothing wrong with them at all. A company that I found, Western Insurance Securities, was trading for $3/share when it was earning $20/share!! I tried to buy up as much of it as possible. No one will tell you about these businesses. You have to find them.Other examples: Genesee Valley Gas, public utility trading at a P/E of 2, GEICO, Union Street Railway of New Bedford selling at $30 when $100/share is sitting in cash, high yield position in 2002. No one will tell you about these ideas, you have to find them.The answer is still yes today that you can still earn extraordinary returns on smaller amounts of capital. For example, I wouldn't have had to buy issue after issue of different high yield bonds. Having a lot of money to invest forced Berkshire to buy those that were less attractive. With less capital, I could have put all my money into the most attractive issues and really creamed it.I know more about business and investing today, but my returns have continued to decline since the 50's. Money gets to be an anchor on performance. At Berkshire's size, there would be no more than 200 common stocks in the world that we could invest in if we were running a mutual fund or some other kind of investment business.",1
32, Do you believe that we'll have significant mispricings again? And if you were 26 today how would you generate the 50% returns that you said you might do with smaller amounts of capital?,"Attractive opportunities come from observing human behavior. In 1998, people behaved like frightened cavemen (referring to the Long Term Capital Management meltdown). People make their own opportunities. They will be frozen by fear, excited by greed and it doesn’t matter what their IQ, degrees etc is. Growth of 50% per year is with small capitalization, not large cap. The point is I got rich looking for stock with strong earnings.The last 50 years weren’t unique. It’s just capitalizing on human behavior. It’s people that make opportunities when others are frozen by fear or excited by greed. Human behavior allows for success if you are able to detach yourself emotionally.In 1951, I got out of school at 20 years old. At the time there were two publishers of stock information, Moody’s and Standards and Poor’s. I used Moody’s and went through every manual. I recently bought a copy of the 1951 Moody off of Amazon. On page 1433, there’s a stock you could have made some money on. The EPS was $29 and the Price Range was from $3-$21/share. On another page, there is a company that had an EPS of $29.5 and the price range was $27-28, 1x earnings. You can get rich finding things like this, things that aren’t written about.A couple of years ago I got this investment guide on Korean stocks. I began looking through it. It felt like 1974 all over again. Look here at this company.Dae Han, I don't know how you pronounce it, it’s a flour company. It earned 12,879 won previously. It currently had a book value of 200,000 won and was earning 18,000 won. It had traded as high as 43,000 and as low as 35,000 won. At the time, the current price was 40,000 or 2 times earnings. In 4 hours I had found 20 companies like this.The point is nobody is going to tell you about these companies. There are no broker reports on Dae Han Flour Company. When you invest like this, you will make money. Sure 1 or 2 companies may turn out to be poor choices, but the others will more than make up for any losses. Not all of them will be good, but some will and those will make you rich. And this didn’t happen in 1932, this was in 2004! These opportunities will be there in the next 30 years. You’ll have streaks where you’ll find some bad companies and a few times where you’ll make money with everything that you do.The Wall Street analysts are brilliant people; they are better at math, but we know more about human nature.In your investing life you will have several opportunities and one or two that can’t go wrong. For example, in 1998 the NY fed offered a 30-year treasury bonds yielding less then the 29-½ year treasury bonds by 30 basis points. What happened was LTCM put a trade on at 10 basis points and it was a crowded trade, they were 100% certain to make money but they could not afford any hiccups. I know more about human nature; these were MIT grads, really smart guys, and they almost toppled the system with their highly leveraged trading.This was definitely a good time to act.",1
33," You have often spoken of the difficulties of compounding large sums of money. But in an article I read, you were quoted as saying that you think you could compound 50% returns on small sums of money, say $1 million. Where could you find those kind of investments in today’s market?","I was misquoted in that article. I get together with about 60 people every couple years and get their expectations of returns. Of those investors, I think there’s a half dozen who could get those kinds of returns - but they’re only going to find those returns in small places.I stumble onto those things occasionally but I’m not looking for them. I’m looking for things that Berkshire Hathaway can do.",1
34, Could you describe the capital allocation process you follow? How do you determine the charges for capital to your different managers?,"There is no better way to make managers understand how valuable capital is than to charge them for it. The amount charged to them can depend on elements such as the history of the subsidiary and the level of interest rates, and has varied from 14 to 20 percent at times. The important thing, Buffett emphasized, is that “we don’t want managers to think of other people’s money as “free"" money.",1
35, What filters do you use when looking at companies?,"Well, opportunity cost is a huge filter in life.

36, What filters do you use when looking at companies?,"We know instantly whether a business is something we're going to understand, and whether it's a business that's going to have a sustainable edge, and that gets rid of a very significant percentage of opportunities. I'm sure people regard me and Charlie as very arbitrary--in the middle of the first sentence, we'll say, ""We appreciate the call, but we're not interested."" I'm sure that if they explain something I might get buttered on it, but we really can tell in the middle of the first sentence whether those two factors exist.We can sometimes tell by who we're dealing with, whether a deal is ever going to work out or not. I mean, if there's an auction going on, we have no interest in talking about it. If someone is interested in doing that with their business, then they're going to want to sit down and renegotiate everything with us all over again after the deal is done.We don't want to listen to stories all day, and we don't need brokerage reports. There's other things to do with your time.-----------------------------------------------------Q - Besides the type of management that you look for, when you look at financials you make decisions rather quickly. In regards to the financial information and the business overall what factors do you look at?We make quick decisions because we have filters before we get to the point of making a decision.Filter #1 – Can we understand the business? What will it look like in 10-20 years? Take Intel vs. chewing gum or toilet paper. We invest within our circle of competence. Jacob’s Pharmacy created Coke in 1886. Coke has increased per capita consumption every year it has been in existence. It’s because there is no taste memory with soda. You don’t get sick of it. It’s just as good the 5th time of the day as it was the 1st time of the day.Filter #2 – Does the business have a durable competitive advantage? This is why I won’t buy into a hula-hoop, pet rock, or a Rubik’s cube company. I will buy soft drinks and chewing gum. This is why I bought Gillette and Coke.Filter #3 – Does it have management I can trust?Filter #4 – Does the price make sense?Since 1972 we have made no change in the marketing, process etc. Take See’s candy. You cannot destroy the brand of See’s candy. Only See’s can do that. You have to look at the brand as a promise to the customer that we are going to offer the quality and service that is expected. We link the product with happiness. You don’t see See’s candy sponsoring the local funeral home. We are at the Thanksgiving Day Parades though.",1
37, How would you recommend an individual investor who follows the Graham and Dodd philosophy to allocate their capital today?,"Well, it depends whether they are going to be an active investor. Graham distinguished between the defensive and the enterprising and that. So if you are going to spend a lot of time on investment, you know I just advise looking at as many things as possible and you will find some bargains. And when you find them, you have to act. It doesn't -- it hasn't changed at all since I was here in 1950, 1951. And it won't change the rest of my life. You start turning pages. When I got out of school, I turned every page in Moody's 10,000-some pages twice, looking for companies. And you have to find them yourself. The world isn't going to tell you about great deals. You have to find them yourself. And that takes a fair amount of time. So if you are not going to do that, if you are just going to be a passive investor, then I just advise an index fund more consistently over a long period of time. The one thing I will tell you is the worst investment you can have is cash. Everybody is talking about cash being king and all that sort of thing. Most of you don't look like you are overburdened with cash anyway. Cash is going to become worth less over time. But good businesses are going to become worth more over time. And you don't want to pay too much for them so you have to have some discipline about what you pay. But the thing to do is find a good business and stick with it.Becky - Does that mean you think we are through the roughest times? You had always kept the cash word around, too.We always keep enough cash around so I feel very comfortable and don't worry about sleeping at night. But it's not because I like cash as an investment. Cash is a bad investment over time. But you always want to have enough so that nobody else can determine your future essentially. The worst -- the financial panic is behind us. The economic spillout which came to some extent from that financial panic is still with us. It will end. I don't know if it will end tomorrow or next week or next month. Or maybe a year. But it won't go on forever. And to sit around and try and pick the bottom, people were trying to do that last March and the bottom hadn't come in unemployment and the bottom hadn't come in business but the bottom had come in stocks. Don't pass up something that's attractive today because you think you will find something way more attractive tomorrow.----------------------------------------------------We have $16 billion in cash not because of any predictions about a market decline, but because we can't find anything that makes us want to part with that cash. We're not positioning ourselves. We just try to do smart things every day, and if there's nothing smart, then we sit on cash.",1

39, What impacts have Graham/Dodd and Phil Fisher had on your investment philosophy? What percentage of your investment philosophy would you attribute to each of them?,"Well, good things would have happened with following either party. Graham obviously had more influence on me than Phil. I worked for Ben, I went to school under him, and his three basic ideas: look at stocks as businesses; have a proper attitude toward the market; and operate with a margin of safety--they all come straight from Graham. Phil Fisher opened my eyes a little more toward trying to find a wonderful business. Charlie did more of that than Phil did, but Phil was espousing that entirely, and I read his books in the early 60s. Phil's still alive, and I owe Phil a lot, but Ben was one of a kind.I enjoyed making money more than Ben. With Ben it really was incidental, at least by the time I knew him. The process, the whole game, didn't interest him more than a dozen other things may have interested him. With me, I just find it interesting, and therefore I've spent a much higher percentage of my timing thinking about investing, and thinking about businesses. I probably know way more about businesses than Ben ever did. He had other things that interested him. I pursued the game quite a bit differently than he did, and therefore comparing the record is not proper.",1
40," Since Ben Graham isn't around anymore, what money managers do you respect today? Is there a Ben Graham today?","You don't need another Ben Graham. You don't need another Moses. There were only Ten Commandments; we're still waiting for the eleventh. His investing philosophy is still alive and well. There are disciples of him around, but all we are doing is parroting. I did read Phil Fisher later on, which showed the more qualitative aspects of businesses. Common stocks are part of a business. Markets are there to serve you, not to instruct you. You can often find a couple of companies that are out of line. Find one; get rich. Most people think that what the stock does from day to day contains information, but it doesn't. It isn't just something that wiggles around. The stock market is the best game in the world. You can take advantage of people who have no morals. High prices inside of a year will typically be 100% of the low price. Businesses don't change in value that much. That is simply crazy. There are extreme degrees of fluctuation, and Mr. Market will call out the prices. Wait until he is nutty in one direction or the other. Put in a margin of safety. Don't find a bridge that says no more than 10,000 pounds when you have a 9800 pound vehicle. It isn't a function of IQ, but receptivity of the mind.When investing you don't have to invest in all 10,000 companies available, you just have to find the one that is out of line. Mr. Market is your servant. Mr. Market is your partner and wants to sell the business to you everyday. Some days he is very optimistic and wants a high price, others he is pessimistic and will sell at a low price. You have to use this to your advantage. The market is the greatest game in the world. There is nothing else that can, at times, get this far out of line with reality. For example, land usually only fluctuates within a 15% band. Negotiated transactions are less volatile. Some get this; others don't. Just keep your wits about you and you can make a lot of money in the market.",1

42," If you were to teach an investment course, besides works by Ben Graham and Phil Fisher and your book on the instalment basis, what would be on the syllabus?","Q - how would you teach the next generation of investors?. I had 49 university groups, in clumps of six, visit me last year. An education in investing requires only two courses: How to Value a Business, and How to Think About Markets. You don’t have to know how to value all businesses. Start with a small circle of competence, things you can understand. Look for things that are selling for less than they’re worth. Forget about things you can’t understand. You need to understand accounting, which has enormous limitations. You need to understand when a competitive advantage is durable or fleeting. Learn that the market is there to serve you, not instruct you. In the investing business, if you have an IQ of 150, sell 30 points to someone else. You do not need to be a genius. You need to have emotional stability, inner peace and be able to think for yourself, since you’re subjected to all sorts of stimuli. It’s not a complicated game; you don’t need to understand math. It’s simple, but not easy. My experience has given me a jaundiced view of academia generally. Efficient market theory—that everything is priced appropriately—is bunk. There’s a certain degree to which ideas that are nutty take hold and propagate. Max Planck remarked about the resistance of the human mind to new ideas: “Science advances one funeral at a time.”",1

44, What's the temperament of successful investors?,"I think it's almost impossible to do well investing over time without this. If the market closed for years, we wouldn't care. Would still keep making Sees candy, Dilly bars, etc.If you focus on the price, you're assuming that the market knows more than you do. That may be the truth, but in that case you shouldn't own it. The stock market is there to serve you, not to instruct you.Focus on price and value. If a stock gets cheaper and you have some cash, buy more. We sometimes stop buying when prices goes up. This cost us $8 billion a few years ago when we were buying Wal-Mart. When we're buying something, we want the price to go down and down and down.You don't have to be right on everything or 20%, 10%, or 5% of businesses. You only have to be right one or two times a year. I used to handicap horses. You can come up with a very profitable decision on a single company. If someone asked me to handicap the 500 companies in the S&P 500, I wouldn't do a very good job. You only have to be right a few times in your lifetime, as long as you don't make any big mistakes.Ted Williams, in his book The Science of Hitting, talked about how he carved up the strike zone into different zones and only swung at pitches that were in his sweet spot.

It should shout at you, without all the spreadsheets. We see something better. The priesthood has to look like they know more than “a bird in the hand.” You won’t get tenure if you say “a bird in the hand.” False precision is totally crazy. The markets saw it in the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund in 1998. It only happens to people with high IQs. The markets of mid-September last year were such that you can’t calculate standard deviations. People’s actions don’t observe laws of math.

We were called by Goldman Sachs on a Wednesday for $5 billion, and we already had a $5 billion commitment to Constellation Energy, $3 billion on Dow Chemical, $6.5 billion on the Wrigley Mars deal. We never want to get dependent on banks. It’s a good sign that we haven’t had the flurry of phone calls like last year.

56, What are your views on diversification?,"I have 2 views on diversification. If you are a professional and have confidence, then I would advocate lots of concentration. For everyone else, if it’s not your game, participate in total diversification. The economy will do fine over time. Make sure you don’t buy at the wrong price or the wrong time. That’s what most people should do, buy a cheap index fund, and slowly dollar cost average into it. If you try to be just a little bit smart, spending an hour a week investing, you’re liable to be really dumb.If it’s your game, diversification doesn’t make sense. It’s crazy to put money into your 20th choice rather than your 1st choice. “Lebron James” analogy. If you have Lebron James on your team, don’t take him out of the game just to make room for someone else. If you have a harem of 40 women, you never really get to know any of them well.Charlie and I operated mostly with 5 positions. If I were running 50, 100, 200 million, I would have 80% in 5 positions, with 25% for the largest. In 1964 I found a position I was willing to go heavier into, up to 40%. I told investors they could pull their money out. None did. The position was American Express after the Salad Oil Scandal. In 1951 I put the bulk of my net worth into GEICO. Later in 1998, LTCM was in trouble. With the spread between the on-the-run versus off-the-run 30 year Treasury bonds, I would have been willing to put 75% of my portfolio into it. There were various times I would have gone up to 75%, even in the past few years. If it’s your game and you really know your business, you can load up.Over the past 50-60 years, Charlie and I have never permanently lost more than 2% of our personal worth on a position. We’ve suffered quotational loss, 50% movements. That’s why you should never borrow money. We don’t want to get into situations where anyone can pull the rug out from under our feet.In stocks, it’s the only place where when things go on sale, people get unhappy. If I like a business, then it makes sense to buy more at 20 than at 30. If McDonalds reduces the price of hamburgers, I think it’s great.-------------------------------------------------The question is about diversification. I have a dual answer to that. If you are not a professional investor. If your goal is not to manage money to earn a significantly better return than the world, then I believe in extreme diversification. I believe 98% - 99% who invest should extensively diversify and not trade, so that leads them to an index fund type of decision with very low costs. All they are going to do is own part of America. And they have made a decision that owning a part of America is worthwhile. I don’t quarrel with that at all. That is the way they should approach it unless they want to bring an intensity to the game to make a decision and start evaluating businesses. Once you are in the businesses of evaluating businesses and you decide that you are going to bring the effort and intensity and time involved to get that job done, then I think diversification is a terrible mistake to any degree. I got asked that question the other day at SunTrust. If you really know businesses, you probably shouldn’t own more than six of them.If you can identify six wonderful businesses, that is all the diversification you need. And you will make a lot of money. And I can guarantee that going into a seventh one instead of putting more money into your first one is gotta be a terrible mistake. Very few people have gotten rich on their seventh best idea. But a lot of people have gotten rich with their best idea. So I would say for anyone working with normal capital who really knows the businesses they have gone into, six is plenty, and I probably have half of what I like best. I don’t diversify personally. All the people I’ve known that have done well with the exception of Walter Schloss, Walter diversifies a lot. I call him Noah, he has two of everything.---------------------------------------------------Q - How do you get confident enough with that smaller level of diversification?. If we were running only our own money, putting 75% of our net worth in a single position is not a problem if it is something we really have high confidence in. Putting 500% or more of your net worth in a position is a problem. Several times I have had 75% of my non-Berkshire net worth in a situation. You will see things where it would be a mistake not to act. You won’t see them often, and the press and your friends won’t be talking about them. Wouldn’t you say, Charlie? 75% is not a real significant amount?. You just had a good banker. Look at LTCM — they put 25x their money in things that had to converge but couldn’t play out the hand. There are people in this room with more than 90% of their worth in Berkshire. I saw things in 2002 in junk bonds that would have been worth going heavily into. You could have bought Cap Cities in 1974 — selling for one-third the property value, with the best manager, and in a good business. You could have put 100% in Coca-Cola when we bought it and that wouldn’t have been a dangerous position. Students learn corporate finance at business schools. They are taught that the whole secret is diversification. But the exact rule is the opposite. The ‘know-nothing’ investor should practice diversification, but it is crazy if you are an expert. The goal of investment is to find situations where it is safe not to diversify. If you only put 20% into the opportunity of a life-time, you are not being rational. Very seldom do we get to buy as much of any good idea as we would like to.",1

We have listened to presentation after presentation by investment bankers, but there is always a fee.Comment: A similar question was asked and addressed earlier in the meeting. Short of indefinite operating losses or intractable labor problems, Buffett is not going to spin-off subsidiaries like some poker player passing cards to his right in hopes of “realizing value,” when doing so would damage his reputation as a buyer (and keeper) of businesses.",1
59," Why would you hold stocks forever, if the fundamentals change permanently? (Buy and hold)","We don’t—we sell plenty. If we lose confidence or conditions change, we sell. When in doubt, we keep holding. But for our wholly-owned companies, we hold and won’t sell unless a company promises to lose money indefinitely, or there’s a labor problem. We buy for keeps and won’t sell, even if the offer is for more than the company is worth. If we were wrong, we sell. Last year, I sold a couple of billion dollars’ worth of Johnson & Johnson just to raise cash for other purposes—an unusual situation. Someone asked us earlier what we’d do differently if we owned the whole company Berkshire. The answer is: nothing. We run Berkshire as if we owned 100%. Our peculiarity is our commitment to buy for keeps. People who sell their businesses to Berkshire know we won’t hire some management consultant or leverage it up, and that’s a real advantage. The Berkshire system has legs, as they say in show business.",1

61," Why do you think that despite making your methods publicly available, that relatively few people have been able to emulate your success?","I asked Graham the same question. Everyone took his class at ColumbiaBusiness School. He used current examples, and by the end of the semester you would have a portfolio that would’ve made you money. Graham lived a life of sharing. He may have had more money hoarding, but lived happier because of it. The money’s just a figure in the paper, perhaps he would’ve died with 86 million instead of 42 million, but it doesn’t really matter. 90% of the people that took his class ended up doing something else.At age 11 I started investing, purchasing three shares of Cities Service Preferred. I had read every book on investing in the Omaha library. I was really into charting and technical analysis. I loved it, but didn’t make any money from it. At 19 I read Graham’s “The Intelligent Investor” and it changed my world. Did Ben lose because I read his book? Maybe we competed and he made less money, but it didn’t matter to Graham.The philosophy either takes immediately or it doesn’t at all. The reason gets down to temperament. People want to make money fast, but it doesn’t happen that way. Graham’s philosophy doesn’t promise enough for many people. You don’t know when it will happen, but you just wait for the fat pitches within your circle of competence. It’s not as exciting as guessing whether the stock price will go up the next day. Most investors in internet companies didn’t know the market cap. They were buying because they thought the stock would move, but if you asked them to write “I would buy XYZ company for $6 billion because”, they wouldn’t get halfway through the sentence. It’s the classic tortoise versus hare, bound to work over time. Charlie and I have educated competitors. Most don’t compete with us, though. It’s fine, we have more than enough money.",1

65, Could you give us your definition of stock market risk,"We think first in terms of business risk. The key to Graham's approach to investing is not thinking of stocks as stocks or part of the stock market. Stocks are part of a business. People in this room own a piece of a business. If the business does well, they're going to do all right as long as long as they don't pay way too much to join in to that business. So we're thinking about business risk. Business risk can arise in various ways. It can arise from the capital structure. When somebody sticks a ton of debt into a business, if there's a hiccup in the business, then the lenders foreclose. It can come about by their nature--there are just certain businesses that are very risky. Back when there were more commercial aircraft manufacturers, Charlie and I would think of making a commercial  airplane as a sort of bet-your-company risk because you would shell out hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars before you really had customers, and then if you had a problem with the plane, the company could go. There are certain businesses that inherently, because of long lead time, because of heavy capital investment, basically have a lot of risk. Commodity businesses have a lot of risk unless you're a low-cost producer, because the low-cost producer can put you out of business. Our textile business was not the low-cost producer. We had fine management, everybody worked hard, we had cooperative unions, all kinds of things. But we weren't the low-cost producers so it was a risky business. The guy who could sell it cheaper than we could made it risky for us. We tend to go into businesses that are inherently low risk and are capitalized in a way that that low risk of the business is transformed into a low risk for the enterprise. The risk beyond that is that even though you identify such businesses, you pay too much for them. That risk is usually a risk of time rather than principal, unless you get into a really extravagant situation. Then the risk becomes the risk of you yourself--whether you can retain your belief in the real fundamentals of the business and not get too concerned about the stock market. The stock market is there to serve you and not to instruct you. That's a key to owning a good business and getting rid of the risk that would otherwise exist in the market.You mention volatility--it doesn't make any difference to us whether the volatility of the stock market is a half a percentage of a point a day, or a quarter percent a day, or five percent a day. In fact, we'd probably make a lot more money if volatility was higher because it would create more mistakes in the market. Volatility is a huge plus to the real investor. Ben Graham used the example of Mr. Market. Ben said that just imagine that when you bought a stock you in effect bought into a business where you have this obliging partner who comes around every day and offers you a price at which he'll either buy or sell and that price is identical. No one ever gets that in a private business, where daily you get a buy-sell offer by a party. But you get that in the stock market, and that's a huge advantage. And it's a bigger advantage if this partner of yours is a heavy-drinking manic depressive. (laughter) The crazier he is, the more money you're going to make. So, as an investor, you love volatility. Not if you're on margin, but if you're an investor you're not on margin, and if you're an investor you love to get these wild swings because it means more things are going to get mispriced. Actually, volatility in recent years has dampened from what it used to be. It looks bigger because people think in terms of Dow points, but volatility was much higher many years ago than it is now. The amplitude of the swings used to be really wild and that gave you more opportunity. Charlie?Finance departments believe that volatility equals risk. They want to measure risk, and they don't know how to do it, basically. So they said volatility measures risk. I've often used the example of the Washington Post's stock. When I first bought it in 1973 it had gone down almost 50%, from a valuation of the whole company of close to $170 million down to $80 million. Because it happened pretty fast, the beta of the stock had actually increased, and a professor would have told you that the company was more risky if you bought it for $80 million than if you bought it for $170 million. That's something I've thought about ever since they told me that 25 years ago and I still haven't figured it out. (laughter)-------------------------------------------------------One key aspect to risk is how long you expect to hold an investment, i.e., stock in Coca Cola might be very risky if bought for a day trade or to hold for only a week. But, over a 5 or 10 year period it probably has almost no risk at all.The myth that volatility of a stock somehow equates to risk was discussed. In fact, volatility often creates great opportunity, in Buffett's view. The following comments on risk in investments were in the 1993 Annual Report, on page 14:""Charlie and I decided long ago that in an investment lifetime it's just too hard to make hundreds of smart decisions. That judgment became ever more compelling as Berkshire's capital mushroomed and the universe of investments that could significantly affect our results shrank dramatically. Therefore, we adopted a strategy that required our being smart- and not too smart at that - only a very few times. Indeed, we'll now settle for one good idea a year. (Charlie says it's my turn.)The strategy we've adopted precludes our following standard diversification dogma. Many pundits would therefore say the strategy must be riskier than that employed by more conventional investors. We disagree. We believe that a policy of portfolio concentration may well decrease risk if it raises, as it should, both the intensity with which an investor thinks about a business and the comfort level he must feel with its economic characteristics before buying into it. In stating this opinion, we define risk, using dictionary terms, as ""the possibility of loss or injury"".Academics, however, like to define investment ""risk"" differently, averring that it is the relative volatility of a stock or portfolio of stocks - that is, their volatility as compared to that of a large universe of stocks. Employing data bases and statistical skills, these academics compute with precision the ""beta"" of a stock - its relative volatility in the past - and then build arcane investment and capital-allocation theories around this calculation. In their hunger for a single statistic to measure risk, however, they forget a fundamental principle: It is better to be approximately right than precisely wrong"".For owners of a business - and that's the way we think of shareholders - the academics' definition of risk is far off the mark, so much so that it produces absurdities. For example, under beta-based theory, a stock that has dropped very sharply compared to the market - as had Washington Post when we bought it in 1973 - becomes ""riskier"" at the lower price than it was at the higher price. Would that description have then made any sense to someone who was offered the entire company at a vastly-reduced price?-------------------------------------------------------""We regard using a stock's volatility as a measure of risk is nuts. Risk to us is 1) the risk of permanent loss of capital, or 2) the risk of inadequate return. Some great businesses have very volatile returns -- for example, See's usually loses money in two quarters of each year -- and some terrible businesses can have steady results.If someone starts talking to you about beta, zip up your pocketbook.""-------------------------------------------------------We think the best way to minimize risk is to think. Our default is to have our capital in short-term instruments and only do something when it makes sense.-------------------------------------------------------RE: BetaVolatility does not measure risk. The problem is that the people who have written about and taught volatility do not understand risk. Beta is nice and mathematical, but it’s wrong. Past volatility does not determine risk.Take farmland here in Nebraska: the price of land went from $2,000 to $600 per acre. The beta of farms went way up, so according to standard economic theory, I was taking more risk buying at $600. Most people would know that’s nonsense because farms aren’t traded. But stocks are traded and jiggle around and so people who study markets translate past volatility into all kinds of measures of risk. The whole concept of volatility is useful for people whose career is teaching, but useless to us.Risk comes from the nature of certain kinds of businesses by the simple economics of the business, and from not knowing what you’re doing. If you understand the economics and you know the people, then you’re not taking much risk. We are willing to lose $6 billion in one catastrophe, but our insurance business over time is not very risky. If you own a roulette wheel, you sometimes have to pay 35-to-1, but that’s okay. We would love to own a lot of roulette wheels.",1
66, How much and how does risk factor into your investment decisions? Would you invest in emerging markets?,"In general, emerging markets are not great for me because I need to put a lot of money to work. Risk does not equal beta. Risk comes around because you don’t understand things, not because of beta. There are normally 10 filters or so that I go through when I hear an idea. The first is can I understand the business and understand the downside not just today but five to ten years from now. There have been very few times that I’ve lost 1% of my net worth. I might be risk averse but I am not action adverse. Mrs. B saved $500 over the course of 16 years to start and build Nebraska Furniture Mart. Tom Watson Sr of IBM said, “I’m smart in spots and I stay in those spots.” I just stay within my circle of confidence. When I bought Nebraska Furniture Mart in 1983, Mrs. B took cash and not Berkshire stock. Why? She didn’t understand the value of stock. She understood cash and that is what she took. I need only need to be right a few times and can let thousands of ideas go by.Ted Williams, who wrote the “Science of Hitting,” broke the strike zone into 92 ball shaped sections. He knew, if hit in his sweet spot, he’d hit 430, a little further out, and he’d hit 350. You have to know your sweet spot. The beautiful thing about investing is that it’s a “No called strike game” where unlike baseball the only strikes in investing are when you swing. I don’t have to swing. When I do invest, I don’t care if the stock price goes from $10 to $2 but I do care about if the value went from $10 to $2. Avoid debt. I decided early on that I never wanted to owe more than 25% of my net worth, and I haven’t… except for in the very beginning. I like to play from a position of strength. I always try to have the odds in my favor. When I go to Vegas, I don’t go around putting $5 dollars on the blackjack tables. If someone wants to come to my room and put $5 on my bed, well that’s fine. I like those odds better.",1

If you own great businesses, you should just hold on most of the time, maybe sell if the valuations get extremely high and buy more if they get really cheap like in the early 1970s.",1
73, Do you expect the stock market premium to continue to be 6.5% over bonds?,"I don't think that the stock market will return 6.5% over bonds in the future. Stocks usually yield a little more, but that isn't ordained. Every once in a while, stocks will get very cheap, but it isn't ordained in scripture that this is so. Risk premiums are mostly nonsense. The world isn't calculating risk premiums.The best book prior to Graham was written by Edgar Lawrence Smith in 1924 called Common Stocks as Long Term Investments. It was a study that evaluated how bonds compared to stocks in various decades of the past. There weren't a whole lot of publicly traded companies back then. He thought he knew what he was going to find. He thought that he'd find that bonds outperformed stocks during periods of deflation, and stocks outperformed during inflationary times. But what he found was that stocks outperformed the bonds in nearly all cases. John M. Keynes then enumerated the reasons that this was so. He said that over time you have more capital working for you, and thus dividends would grow higher. This was novel information back then and investors then went crazy and started buying stocks for these higher returns. But then they started to get crazy, and no longer really applied the sound tactics that made the reasons given in the book true. Be careful that when you buy something for a sound reason, make sure that the reason stays sound.If you buy GM, you need to write the price and the respective market valuation. Then write down why you are buying the business. If you can't, then you have no business doing it.Quote from Ben Graham: “You can get in more trouble with a sound premise than an unsound premise because you'll just throw out the unsound premise”.",1

Jon is referring to an article I wrote for Fortune in the 1970’s - and he’s also referring to the tremendous ROE shown on the S&P 500, which includes the effects of restructurings.Even allowing for the effects of stock options, I have still been surprised by the returns on equity shown by the S&P 500. As for options, we look at what the value of average option issuance is going to be over the next five years and figure what they’d be worth as warrants to the issuing company. That’s what we use as a cost to shareholders.This should be shown as an expense in the income statement. I think a number of auditors believed it should be a cost but their clients pressured them and caved, and then Congress got called in. I think it’s a scandal. Charlie?. It’s fundamentally wrong not to have honest accounting. It’s wrong to have little corruptions, that later can become big corruptions. The accounting in America is corrupt. It is not a good idea to have corrupt accounting.It’s like campaign reform. Once you get a number of players benefitting, it’s hard to get reform. It’s the same thing with options accounting. It would have been better to have reform a couple decades ago, when it wasn’t such a big thing.That doesn’t mean that we’re against options. They could make sense here at some point, but not with Charlie and me.---------------------------------------------------It's not out of the realm of possibility though. You can never predict what markets will do. In Japan, a 10 year bond is yielding 5/8 of 1%. Who could have ever imagined that?Chaotic markets might not be good for society, but create opportunities for us.There were some great opportunities in junk bonds last year and we invested in a few. But money is pouring into junk bonds right now, $1 billion per week. The world hasn't changed that much.",1

77, Do you think investors expect too much?,"The problem is the starting point in predicting modest returns for equity investors. Expectations were too high. In 1999, a Gallup poll showed people expected 15% returns from stocks in a low inflation environment. In a low inflation environment, how much will GDP grow? If there's 2% inflation and 3% real growth, that's 5%. This will be the rate of corporate growth, so if you add dividends, you get 6-7% annualized returns before frictional costs -- and investors incur high frictional costs (they don't have to, but they do) -- which adds up to 1.5%. This 4.5-5.5% is not bad.It 6-7% growth is not the end of the world. If we get 5-6% of the pie -- those of us who put our capital out -- I don't know if it's exactly what someone who designed the universe would come up with, but I don't think that's crazy in either direction. It provides a pretty decent real return in a period of low inflation. If you get high inflation, you could get very low real returns, even negative.Maybe we should export all economists to China.---------------------------------------------------Re: NYSE’s Merger with ArchipelagoI personally think it would be better if the NYSE remained as a neutral, not-for-big-profit institution. The exchange has done a very good job over the centuries. It’s one of the most important institutions in the world.The enemy of investment success is activity. The exchange of yesterday will be better for the American investor. I know the American investor will not be better off if volume doubles on the NYSE, and I know the NYSE will be trying to figure out how to do that if it is trying to maximize its own earnings per share.Trading is the frictional cost of capitalism. GM or IBM will not earn more money if their stock turns over more actively, but a for-profit NYSE will.I wish I’d gone to first grade where he did. (Laughter)",1

80, Do you prefer public or private investments?,"Berkshire has previously said that they would prefer more private investments but have trouble finding suitable ones. At the present time, the public market offers more opportunity. There are very few good private situations around and those that are available tend to be overpriced. Berkshire has a billion dollars in cash at present.Buffett says there is more possibility of significant ""mispricing"" in the public stock market. This is because emotion plays a larger role in the public market, and the very superficial knowledge with which most investors operate. Owners of significant private business on the other hand, tend to have a much better idea of what their businesses are really worth.There is very tough competition currently for the few good private businesses of decent size from: MBO funds or LBO funds. Typically these funds are run by people using other people's capital; they benefit from upside but don't suffer as much from downside since it is not their money that is at stake. Therefore, they are less worried about overpaying for a businessOther public companies. They don't mind overpaying; management of these types of companies are often more focused on size, than on return on investment and often are not big shareholders. These types of buyers don't mind issuing new stock in payment, whereas Berkshire doesn't like to issue new common stock.Buffett definitely feels that the ""stock market is far less efficient than the private market"".",1
81, Investors eventually repeat their mistakes. How can you prevent this--through fast growth or safety?,"If you understood a business perfectly and the future of the business, you would need very little in the way of a margin of safety. So, the more vulnerable the business is, assuming you still want to invest in it, the larger margin of safety you'd need. If you're driving a truck across a bridge that says it holds 10,000 pounds and you've got a 9,800 pound vehicle, if the bridge is 6 inches above the crevice it covers, you may feel okay, but if it's over the Grand Canyon, you may feel you want a little larger margin of safety in terms of driving only drive a 4,000 pound truck across. It depends on the nature of the underlying risk. We don't get the margin of safety now that we got in the 1970s.The best thing is to learn from other guys' mistakes. Patton used to say, ""It's an honor to die for your country; make sure the other guy gets the honor."" There are a lot of mistakes that I've repeated. The biggest one, the biggest category over time, is being reluctant to pay up a little for a business that I knew was really outstanding. The cost of that I think is in the billions, and I'll probably keep making that mistake. The mistakes are made when there are businesses you can understand and that are attractive and you don't do something about them. I don't worry at all about the mistakes that come about like when I met Bill Gates and didn't buy Microsoft or something like that. Most of our mistakes have been mistakes of omission rather than commission.",1
82, Why do large caps outperform small caps?,"We don't care if a company is large cap, small cap, middle cap, micro cap. It doesn't make any difference. The only questions that matter to us:*   Do we understand the business?*   Do we like the people running it?*   And does it sell for a price that is attractive?From my personal standpoint running Berkshire now because we got, pro forma for Gen. Re, $75 to $80 billion to invest in and I only want to invest in five things, so I am really limited to very big companies. But if I were investing $100,000, I wouldn't care whether something was large cap or small cap or anything. I would just look for businesses I understood.Now, I think, on balance, large cap companies as businesses have done extraordinarily well the last ten years--way better than people anticipated they would do. You really have American businesses earning close to something 20% on equity. And that is something nobody dreamed of and that is being produced by very large companies in aggregate. So you have had this huge revaluation upwards because of lower interest rates and much higher returns on capital. If America business is really a disguised bond that earns 20%, a 20% coupon it is much better than a bond with a 13% coupon. And that has happened with big companies in recent years, whether it is permanent or not is another question. I am skeptical of that. I wouldn't even think about it--except for questions of how much money we run--I wouldn't even think about the size of the business. See's Candy was a $25 million business when we bought it. If I can find one now, as big as we are, I would love to buy it. It is the certainty of it that counts.",1

84, What is the definition of Value vs. Growth stocks?,"No two distinct categories of business. PV of cash a company generates is what the business is worth. No distinction in our mind between growth & value. All decision you decide how much value you are going to get. When we buy a stock we think of it in terms of buying the whole enterprise.Aesop's wrote the first investment primer ""A bird in the hand (Lay out cash today) is worth two in the bush"".

85," From the partnership letters in 1964, you had a strategy called ‘generals relatively undervalued.’ We have recently begun to implement a technique where we buy something at 12x, when comps sell at 20x. Comps go to 10x. Is this pair trading?","Yes, we didn’t know we started so early. Ben Graham did it in 1920. He did pair trading. He was right 4 out of 5, but the last one would kill him. We shorted the market to some degree. We would borrow stocks from universities. We were early in this. We wouldn’t short a stock because it was unattractive but as a general market short hedge. I would borrow from the Treasurer of Columbia University, “which ones do you want”, “just give me all of them”. It provoked some odd looks when I told the universities I wanted to short all of their stocks. It was not a big deal. We might have made a little money on it in the 1960s, but it is not something we do these days. If you have good long ideas on businesses that are undervalued, it is not necessary to short. 130/30 simultaneously holding a 130% exposure to a long portfolio; and a 30% exposure to a short portfolio is being marketed today. Many will sell you the idea of the day. No great statistical merit. We made our money by being long wonderful businesses, not by using a long-short strategy.",1

88, What is the benefit of being an out-of-towner as opposed to being on Wall Street?,"I worked on Wall Street for a couple of years and I have my best friends on both coasts. I like seeing them. I get ideas when I go there. But the best way to think about investments is to be in a room with no one else and just think. And if that doesn’t work, nothing else is going to work. The disadvantage of being in any type of market environment like Wall Street in the extreme is that you get over-stimulated. You think you have to do something every day. The Chandler family paid $2,000 for this company (Coke). You don’t have to do much else if you pick one of those. And the trick then is not to do anything else. Even not to sell at 1919, which the family did later on. So what you are looking for is some way to get one good idea a year. And then ride it to its full potential and that is very hard to do in an environment where people are shouting prices back and forth every five minutes and shoving reports in front of your nose and all that. Wall Street makes its money on activity. You make your money on inactivity.If everyone in this room trades their portfolio around every day with every other person, you will all end up broke. And the intermediary will end up with all the money. If you all own stock in a group of average businesses and just sit here for the next 50 years, you will end up with a fair amount of money and your broker will be broke. He is like the Doctor who gets paid on how often to get you to change pills. If he gave you one pill that cures you the rest of your life, he would make one sale, one transaction and that is it. But if he can convince you that changing pills every day is the way to great health, it will be great for him and the prescriptionists. You won’t be any healthier and you will be a lot worse off financially. You want to stay away from any environment that stimulates activity. And Wall Street would have the effective of doing that.When I went back to Omaha, I would go back with a whole list of companies I wanted to check out and I would get my money’s worth out of those trips, but then I would go back to Omaha and think about it.",1

Some of my friends have big boats where 55 people are serving 14. Of those 55, some will be stealing from you, some will be sleeping with each other, and I just don’t want to deal with that. My friends have the boats, so I’m the ultimate freeloader. I don’t need multiple houses. If I wanted to do something wild & crazy I could do it, but Anna Nicole Smith is gone. Reminds me of the story of the 60 year old man that got a 25 year old to marry him. When his friends asked how he did it, he replied, “I told her I was 90.”",1
95, When did you know you were rich?,"I really knew I was rich when I had $10,000. I knew along time ago that I was going to be doing something I loved doing with people that I loved doing it with. In 1958, I had my dad take me out of the will, as I knew I would be rich anyway. I let my two sisters have all the estate.I bet we all in this room live about the same. We eat about the same and sleep about the same. We pretty much drive a car for 10 years. All this stuff doesn't make it any different. I will watch the Super Bowl on a big screen television just like you. We are living the same life. I have two luxuries: I get to do what I want to do every day and I get to travel a lot faster than you.You should do the job you love whether or not you are getting paid for it. Do the job you love. Know that the money will follow. I travel distances better than you do. The plane is nicer. But that is about the only thing that I do a whole lot different.I didn't know my salary when I went to work for Graham until I got his first paycheck. Do what you love and don't even think about the money. I will take a trip on Paul Allen's Octopus ($400M yacht), but wouldn't want one for myself. A 60 man crew is needed. They could be stealing, sleeping with each other, etc. Professional sports teams are a hassle, especially when you have as much money as him. Fans would complain that you aren't spending enough when the team loses.If there is a place that is warm in the winter and cool in the summer, and you do what you love doing, you will do fine. You're rich if you are working around people you like. You will make money if you are energetic and intelligent. This society lets smart people with drive earn a very good living. You will be no exception.",1

You could improve on that, many of you, and I certainly could have when I got out, just in terms of learning communication skills.It’s not something that’s taught, I actually went to a Dale Carnegie course later on in terms of public speaking. But if you improve your value 50 percent by having better communication skills, it’s another 500-thousand dollars in terms of capital value. See me after the class and I’ll pay you 150-thousand. You can dramatically increase your value by improving oral and written communication skills.---------------------------------------------------When we were viewed as out of step a few years ago, I didn't care as long as I felt okay about how Berkshire was doing.",1

I read it early in 1950, and I think it’s as good a book now as then. You can’t get a bad result if you follow it. The Intelligent Investor has three big lessons:1.  think of a stock as a part owner- ship of a business;2.  the market is there to serve you, not instruct you; and3.  always require a margin of safety.

104," Don't you have a lot of competition to buy great businesses? For example, from private equity funds?","You are absolutely correct that the private equity funds are a form of competition for Berkshire. Stocks sometimes trade well below intrinsic value, but businesses are sold in a negotiated transaction, so pricing doesn’t get as extreme. But our strong preference is to buy entire businesses at a fair price rather than stocks, even if stocks can be acquired a bit cheaper.If someone wants what we are offering, we are pretty much one-of-a-kind. People can sell their company to us, yet continue to run it as they please as long as they want. So, if someone needs liquidity for tax or inheritance or other reasons, but doesn’t want to auction their business off like a piece of meat, they can come to us and they know they’ll get the response they want. We don’t get super bargains this way, but it allows us to put money to work at a sensible price.Acquisitions don’t come along every day.If I owned a business that my father had started and wanted to monetize it, I would sell to Berkshire because I wouldn’t want to split it up to auction it off, just as it would be silly to auction your daughter off to the man who bids the most.There is no-one else who can make the promises we can make not to ever sell the acquired company. Most big companies can’t do that because what if the board decides it wants a pure play? I tell sellers that I’m the only one who can double cross you – nobody else can. We don’t have consultants or Wall Street advisors.But, yes, we do have a lot of competition.---------------------------------------------------We are positioned very badly in terms of buying businesses. Berkshire will not do as well as long as this persists.Five or six years ago, I got a call from a well-known investor who asked me a lot of questions about reinsurance. He didn’t know much about the business, but he was considering buying a reinsurance company because, as he explained to me, he would have to send his investors’ money back to them if he didn’t invest it in the next few months, and he was earning 2% annually on it.We unlike this gentleman have all of our net worth on the downside as well. If we have 2 and 20 2% management fee and a 20% performance allocation on the upside and nothing but a goodbye kiss on the downside.The competition right now is tough, so our efforts to buy businesses are likely to be futile. But there are 1-2 deals we might get done.We don’t see any deals recently that we wish we’d made – this wasn’t true in the past – even if the price had been 10% lower. We’re in a different world right now.---------------------------------------------------There’s no doubt that there’s far more money looking a deals now than in the past. They’re willing to pay up to buy good but mundane businesses that we’ve historically bought and had success with. Now it’s not just private equity funds getting in – hedge funds are too.There’s been a bit of a change in the past few weeks, as it’s gotten a little harder to borrow money, but overall, we can’t compete, which makes us feel distress.But it won’t go on forever. In the near term, we are not positioned favorably at all, but you’d be amazed at just how fast things can change. Things happen to change the landscape. At least three times in my career, there’s been so much money sloshing around. It was so bad in 1969 that I closed my partnership. But only four years later, it was the best time to be a buyer in my entire life.---------------------------------------------------Re: Closed-End FundsHistory shows that over time, almost all closed-end funds go to discounts. Initially, if they’re sold with a 6% commission, the initial people only get 94 cents on the dollar. If I could buy an open fund at X or a closed-end fund at 120% of X, then you’d have to convince me that the management is something special to buy the closed-end fund.Occasionally, Charlie and I have seen closed-end funds that trade at a premium for a long time. Eventually they will come back down to earth.----------------------------------------------------Q - Is the private-equity boom a bubble?We’re competing with those people, so I started to cry, thinking about the difficulty of finding things to buy.Due to the nature of private equity, it’s not a bubble that will burst. They lock up their money for 5-10 years and buy businesses that don’t price daily. It takes many years for the score to be put on the board and the investors can’t leave. It’s not like leverage in marketable securities.What would slow it down is if the spread between high-yield bonds and safe bonds widens. This would slow down deals, but won’t cause investors to get their money back.There’s another factor: if you have a $20 billion fund and get a 2% fee, you’re getting $400M a year. But you can’t raise another fund with a straight face until you’ve invested it, so there’s a great compulsion to invest it quickly so you can raise another fund and get more fees.We can’t compete against these buyers. We buy forever and it’s our own money. I think it will be quite some time before disillusion sets in among the investors in private-equity funds. The voice of total optimism has spoken. More laughter",1
105, How do you learn who to trust and who not to trust?,We’re deeply suspicious if the proposition sounds too good to be true.

106, How do you learn who to trust and who not to trust?,"I get letters all the time from people who have been taken advantage of in financial transactions. It’s sad. A lot isn’t fraud – just the frictional costs and the baloney. Charlie and I have had very good luck buying businesses and putting our trust in people – it’s been overwhelmingly good, but we filter out a lot of people. People give themselves away and maybe it’s an advantage being around awhile and seeing how people give themselves away by what they talk about and what’s important and not important to them. We’ve had a batting average I wouldn’t have thought we’d have. We haven’t batted 100%, but it’s above 90%. When they make certain kinds of comments, what they laugh about, if they say “it’s so easy.” It’s not so easy. We rule out people 90% of the time. Maybe we’re wrong sometimes, but what’s important is the ones we let in. In the 1970s when I referred my clients to three people as he closed down the Buffett Partnership, when I thought who they should turn over 100% of their money to, there were hundreds of people with great records. I recommended Charlie, Sandy Gottesman and Bill Ruane. I couldn’t have told you which of the three would be the best, but the one thing I was sure of was that they were going to be sensational stewards of money and do what was right for clients rather then try to make 2x in commissions in a given year. Anytime someone who takes what I think is an unfair fee structure because they can get it, I rule them out.",1
107, What's your philosophy on partnering with others?,"We normally don’t want to do deals with partners. If we like a deal, we want to do it all. We have a lot of money, so we don’t need a money partner. As for a knowledge partner, we don’t want to do a deal where we’re relying on someone else. We’ve made a few exceptions, but very few. Charlie, can you think of any?. You did something with Leucadia, but they brought us the deal. Click here(http://www.nasvf.org/cdfa/press.nsf/pages/108) for an article about this deal.. That’s right. They were great. But they invited us to participate in their deal. We came in on the same terms they had. In general, we don’t partner with others on deals, but I’d do another deal with Leucadia if they came to me and I liked the deal. That was a very good experience.",1
108, We know that you are a big bridge player. Do you think that bridge correlates to investing? Are there any traits or characteristics that might carry over from one to the other?,"Bridge is the best game there is. You’re drawing inferences from every bid and play of a card, and every card that is or isn’t played. It teaches you about partnership and other human skills. In bridge, you draw inferences from everything and that carries over well into investing. In bridge, similar to in life, you’ll never get the same hand twice but the past does have a meaning. The past does not make the future definitive but you can draw from those experiences. I think the partnership aspect of bridge is a great lesson for life. If I’m going into battle, I want to partner with the best. I was playing with a world champion and we were playing against my sister and her husband. We lost, so I took the scorepad and I ate it.",1
109, How do you think about value?,"The formula for value was handed down from 600 BC by a guy named Aesop. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. Investing is about laying out a bird now to get two or more out of the bush. The keys are to only look at the bushes you like and identify how long it will take to get them out. When interest rates are 20%, you need to get it out right now. When rates are 1%, you have 10 years. Think about what the asset will produce. Look at the asset, not the beta. I don’t really care about volatility. Stock price is not that important to me, it just gives you the opportunity to buy at a great price. I don’t care if they close the NYSE for 5 years. I care more about the business than I do about events. I care about if there’s price flexibility and whether the company can gain more market share. I care about people drinking more Coke. I bought a farm from the FDIC 20 years ago for $600 per acre. Now I don’t know anything about farming but my son does. I asked him, how much it cost to buy corn, plow the field, harvest, how much an acre will yield, what price to expect. I haven’t gotten a quote on that farm in 20 years.If I were running a business school I would only have 2 courses. The first would obviously be an investing class about how to value a business. The second would be how to think about the stock market and how to deal with the volatility. The stock market is funny. You have no compulsion to act and a bunch of silly people setting prices all the time, it is great odds. I want the market to be like a manic depressive drunk. Graham’s Ch. 8, in the book Intelligent Investor, on Mr. Market is the most important thing I have ever read. Now think about the NYSE. You have thousands of companies to choose from. For me, that universe has shrunk because I need to put large dollar amounts to work. Attitude is much more important than IQ. You can really get into trouble with a high IQ, i.e. Long-Term Capital. You need to have the right philosophical temperament.",1
110, How do you calculate intrinsic value?,"Intrinsic value is terribly important but very fuzzy. We try to work with businesses where we have fairly high probability of knowing what the future will hold. If you own a gas pipeline, not much is going to go wrong. Maybe a competitor enters forcing you to cut prices, but intrinsic value hasn't gone down if you already factored this in. We looked at a pipeline recently that we think will come under pressure from other ways of delivering gas to the area the pipeline serves. We look at this differently from another pipeline that has the lowest costs and does not face threats from alternative pipelines. If you calculate intrinsic value properly, you factor in things like declining prices.When we buy business, we try to look out and estimate the cash it will generate and compare it to the purchase price. We have to feel pretty good about our projections and then have a purchase price that makes sense. Over time, we've had more pleasant surprises than we would have expected.I've never seen an investment banker's book in which future earnings are projected to go down. But many businesses' earnings go down. We made this mistake with Dexter shoes -- it was earning $40 million pretax and I projected this would continue, and I couldn't have been more wrong.20% of Fortune 500 companies will be earning significant less in five years, but I don't know which 20%. If you can't come up with reasonable estimates for that, then you move on.",1

112, What do you believe to be the most important tools in determining intrinsic value?  What rules or standards do you apply when using these tools?,"If we could see in looking at any business what its future cash flows would be for the next 100 years, and discount that back at an appropriate interest rate, that would give us a number for intrinsic value. It would be like looking at a bond that had a bunch of coupons on it that was due in a hundred years.Businesses have coupons too, the only problem is that they're not printed on the instrument and it's up to the investor to try to estimate what those coupons are going to be over time. In high-tech businesses, or something like that, we don't have the faintest idea what the coupons are going to be. In the businesses where we think we can understand them reasonably well, we are trying to print the coupons out. If you attempt to assess intrinsic value, it all relates to cash flow. The only reason to put cash into any kind of investment now is that you expect to take cash out--not by selling it to somebody else, that's just a game of who beats who--but by the asset itself.If you're an investor, you're looking on what the asset is going to do, if you're a speculator, you're commonly focusing on what the price of the object is going to do, and that's not our game. We feel that if we're right about the business, we're going to make a lot of money, and if we're wrong about the business, we don't have any hopes of making money.There are several possible answers to that question! (laughter) The first question we ask ourselves is, would we rather own this business than more Coca-Cola, than more Gillette. We will want companies where the certainty gets close to that, or we would figure we'd be better off buying more Coke. If every management, before they bought a business, said is this better than buying in our own stock or even buying Coca-Cola stock, there'd be a lot less deals done. We try to measure against what we regard as close to perfection as we can get.back to the questions.(https://buffettfaq.com/#questions)Well, we won't stick a price on it. They are absolutely wonderful businesses run by sensational people, and they are selling at prices that are higher than they've sold at most of the time. But they may well be worth it, either in present terms, or they may be a couple of years ahead of themselves. Gillette doesn't repurchase their shares.Coke consistently repurchases their shares. We generally like the policy of companies that have really wonderful businesses repurchasing their shares. The problem with most companies repurchasing their shares is that they are frequently so-so businesses and they are repurchasing shares for purposes other than intensifying the interest of shareholders in a wonderful business. It's hard to do things intelligently with money in this world and Coke has been very intelligent about using their capital, particularly to fortify and develop their bottler network around the world, but there's only so far you can go with that, and to enhance the ownership of shareholders in a company like Coca-Cola is great.The bottling is actually kind of interesting.Asa Canver back in the late 1880's essentially bought the whole Coca-Cola company for $2,000, and that may be the smartest purchase in the history of the world. Then in 1889, a couple of guys from Chattanooga came along, and in those days soft drinks were sold over the counter, and they said bottling's got a future and you're busy with the pump side of the business, so why don't you let us develop the bottling side of the business. And I guess Mr. Canver didn't think much of bottling, so he gave them a contract that gave them the rights, in perpetuity for almost all of the United States, and gave them the right to buy Coca-Cola syrup at a fixed price forever. (audience groans) So Asa, who had scored with his $2,000 in a major way, seems to have made one of the dumbest contracts in history.And the Coca-Cola company was faced over the years with the problem of having this bottling system which soon became the dominant system of distribution for Coke, being subject to a contract where there was no price flexibility and where the contract ran for perpetuity. And of course every bottler on his deathbed would call his children and grandchildren around, and he would prop himself up, and he would croak out in his last breath, ""Don't let 'em screw with the bottling contract."" (laughter)So the Coca-Cola company faced this for decades, and they couldn't really do anything about the bottling system for a long time, and Roberto and Don Keough and some other people spent 20, 25 years getting that rationalized.it was a huge, huge project, but it made an enormous difference over time, and that's what I mean when I talk about intellectual capital. You know you're not going to get results on that in a day or a month or a year, but they decided that to get the job done they had to do this, and they used capital to get that job done, but they used capital beyond that to repurchase shares, and it's been very smart, and they're probably repurchasing shares even as we talk.",1
113," When you estimate intrinsic value in capital intensive companies like McDonald's and Walgreens where a very healthy and growing operating cash flow is largely offset by expenditures for new stores, restaurants, etc how do you estimate future free cash flow? And at what rate do you discount those cash flows?","The concept of a hurdle rate makes nothing but sense, but a lot of people using this make terrible errors. I don’t think there’s any substitute for thinking about a whole lot of investment options and thinking about the returns from each.The trouble isn’t that we don’t have one a hurdle rate – we sort of do – but it interferes with logical comparison. If I know I have something that yields 8% for sure, and something else came along at 7%, I’d reject it instantly. It’s like the mail-order-bride firm offering a bride who has AIDS – I don’t need to waste a moment considering it. Everything is a function of opportunity cost. I’ve been on 19 boards and seen a zillion presentations projecting a certain IRR internal rate of return. If the boards had burned them all, they’d have been better off. The IRR is based on what the CEO wants. The numbers are made up. I have a young friend who sells private partnership interests to investors, and it’s hard to get returns in that field. I asked him, “What returns do you tell them you can get?” He said “20%.” I said, “How did you come up with that number?” He said, “If I told them anything lower, they wouldn’t give me the money.”  The concept of a hurdle rate makes nothing but sense, but a lot of people using this make terrible errors.

And at what rate do you discount those cash flows?","We use the same discount rate across all securities. We may be more conservative in estimating cash in some situations.Just because interest rates are at 1.5% doesn't mean we like an investment that yields 2-3%. We have minimum thresholds in our mind that are a whole lot higher than government rates. When we're looking at a business, we're looking at holding it forever, so we don't assume rates will always be this low.---------------------------------------------------We don’t formally have discount rates. Every time we start talking about this, Charlie reminds me that I’ve never prepared a spreadsheet, but I do in my mind.We just try to buy things that we’ll earn more from than a government bond – the question is, how much higher? If government bonds are at 2%, we’re not going to buy a business that will return 4%.I don’t call Charlie every day and ask him, “What’s our hurdle rate?” We’ve never used the term. There’s no one in the world who can earn 20% on big money. It’s amazing how gullible pension funds and other investors are. They want it so badly that they’ll believe even total nonsense.",1
115, Is the skill of judging risk just as important as calculating intrinsic value?,We perceive risk as items that impair future business. Wants to have mathematical risk on their side over a group of decisions. Not in the business of assuming a lot of risk in business. We look for moats around businesses. We look for castles (businesses) that have a moat surrounding it which is expanding as a primary consideration of a great business.,1
116, What valuation metrics do you use?,"The appropriate multiple for a business compared to the S&P 500 depends on its return on equity and return on incremental invested capital. I wouldn't look at a single valuation metric like relative P/E ratio. I don't think price-to-earnings, price-to-book or price-to-sales ratios tell you very much. People want a formula, but it's not that easy. To value something, you simply have to take its free cash flows from now until kingdom come and then discount them back to the present using an appropriate discount rate. All cash is equal. You just need to evaluate a business's economic characteristics.",1
117, What do you think of the use of book values in making investment decisions?,"Book value is virtually not a consideration in investment decision-making at Berkshire. Their pursuit of high return businesses usually leads to companies with minimal book values. He added that the book value approach could work well with small sums of money, like Graham had managed, and that the approach had worked well for Graham-type practitioners like Buffett’s friend Walter Schloss. The three most important concepts conveyed by Graham in “The Intelligent Investor” were the investor’s attitude toward the market, the “margin of safety”, and the practice of looking at companies as businesses, not stocks.Munger proffered that “projections generally do more harm than good, and are usually prepared by persons who have some sort of an interest in the outcome of actions based on the projections. They often have a precision that’s deceptive.” Buffett added that they’ve never looked at a projection in connection with an equity or business that they’ve acquired. “It’s a ritual to justify doing what an executive or a board wanted to do in the first place.---------------------------------------------------We have a bias toward investing in the U.S., but I bought my first stock outside the United States at least 50 years ago and we’ve looked at plenty of marketable securities overseas. It would make no difference to us if Coke was headquartered in Amsterdam.But nobody outside the U.S. has heard of us. Eitan Wertheimer found us. The Iscar acquisition has contributed to our becoming better known. Eitan is going through a procedure to get us better known abroad. Buffett did not give any details about this “procedure”.I haven’t done a good selling job abroad. We could be fairly criticized for not doing enough to become better known overseas.We own stocks in Germany and 4% of POSCO, which is based in South Korea – it’s now worth over $1 billion. I can think of a half dozen investments we currently have outside the U.S. We don’t have to report them in our SEC Form 13F, so they don’t get picked up like our domestic investments.We have to report our holdings in Germany once we reach 3% ownership. So if we buy a $10 billion market-cap company, that means once we buy $300 million worth we have to tell the world, and Charlie and I don’t like doing that. It screws up our future buying, so the 3% rule is a real minus.I can assure you that the entire world is on our radar screen and we hope to be on its radar screen. John Templeton made a fortune being in Japan very early and stocks there went to 30-40x earnings. It was an admirable piece of investment, but you know, we did alright during the same period.

Let’s leave the market price out. If you were buying a farm, you would think about bushels per acre — you are looking to the asset itself. Ask yourself: do I understand enough about the business so that the financials will be able to tell me meaningful things that will help me to foresee the statements in the future? I have bought stocks the way you describe. They were in businesses I understood, and if I could buy at 40% of X, I’d be okay with the margin of safety. If you don’t tell me the nature of the business, financial statements won’t tell me much. We’ve bought many securities, and with most, we’ve never met management. We use our general understanding of business and look to specifics from financial statements. We could value an apartment if we knew where the apartment is, and we know the monthly checks. I have bought a lot of things off the financials. There is a lot I wouldn’t buy even if it had the best management in the world, as it doesn’t make much difference in a bad business.",1

121, How do you think about growth rates when you value businesses?,"When the long-term growth rate is higher than the discount rate, then mathematically the value is infinity. This is the St. Petersburg Paradox(http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paradox-stpetersburg/), written about by Durand 30 years ago. Click here(http://www.tilsonfunds.com/GrowthStocksSPP.pdf) for a copy of the original 1957 article. For more on this topic, I recommend Integrating the Outliers: Two Lessons from the St. Petersburg Paradox(http://www.turtletrader.com/outliers.pdf), by CSFB’s (now Legg Mason’s) Michael Mauboussin.Some managements think this that the value of their company is infinite. It gets very dangerous to assume high growth rates to infinity – that’s where people get into a lot of trouble. The idea of projecting extremely high growth rates for a long period of time has cost investors an awful lot of money. Go look at top companies 50 years ago: how many have grown at 10% for a long time? And those that have grown 15% is very rarified.Charlie and I are rarely willing to project high growth rates. Maybe we’re wrong sometimes and that costs us, but we like to be conservative.",1
122, What's your philosophy in buying businesses?,"Margin of safety means getting more value than you’re paying. There are many ways to get value. It’s high school algebra; if you can’t do this, then don’t invest. When you’re trying to determine intrinsic value and margin of safety, there’s no one easy method that can simply be mechanically applied by a computer that will make someone who pushes the buttons rich. You have to apply a lot of models. I don’t think you can become a great investor rapidly, no more than you can become a bone-tumor pathologist quickly. Let’s say you decide you want to buy a farm and you make calculations that you can make $70/acre as the owner. How much will you pay per acre for that farm? Do you assume agriculture will get better so you can increase yields? Do you assume prices will go up? You might decide you wanted a 7% return, so you’d pay $1,000/acre. If it’s for sale at $800, you buy, but if it’s at $1,200, you don’t. If you’re going to buy a farm, you’d say, “I bought it to earn $X growing soybeans.” It wouldn’t be based on what you saw on TV or what a friend said. It’s the same with stocks. Take out a yellow pad and say, “If I’m going to buy GM at $30, it has 600 million shares, so I’m paying $18 billion,” and answer the question, why? If you can’t answer that, you’re not subjecting it to business tests.We have to understand the competitive position and dynamics of the business and look out into the future. With some businesses, you can’t. The math of investing was set out by Aesop in 600 BC: a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. We ask ourselves how certain we are about birds in the bush. Are there really two? Might there be more? We simply choose which bushes we want to buy from in the future.The ability to generate cash and reinvest it is critical. It’s the ability to generate cash that gives Berkshire value. We choose to retain it because we think we can reinvest each dollar to generate more than $1 of value.If you were thinking about paying $900,000 or $1.3 million for a McDonald’s stand, you’d think about things like whether people will keep eating hamburgers and whether McDonald’s could change the franchise agreement.

123, What's your philosophy in buying businesses?,"  The first question I ask is: “Does the owner love the business or does he/she love the money?” It’s very easy to tell the difference.*   I am proud to be able to provide a good home for many businesses. It is like finding a home for a painting. Business owners who are looking to sell can either sell their businesses to Berkshire (like putting painting in the Metropolitan Museum of Art) or sell to an LBO and let them tear it up, dress up the accounting, and resell it (like selling a painting to a porn shop).--------------------------------------------------It's a question of being able to identify businesses that you understand and you are very certain about. If you understand those businesses, and many people do, but Charlie and I don't, then you have the opportunity to evaluate them. If you decide they're fairly priced and they have marvellous prospects, you're going to do very well. But there's a whole group of companies--a very large group of companies--that Charlie and I just don't know how to value. And that doesn't bother us. I mean, we don't know how to figure out what cocoa beans are going to do, or the Russian ruble--there's all kinds of financial instruments that we just don't feel we have the knowledge to evaluate. It might be a bit too much to expect somebody would understand every business in the world. We find some that are much harder for us to understand. When I say understand--my definition of understand is that you have to have a pretty good idea of where it's going to be in ten years. I just can't get that conviction with a lot of businesses, whereas I can get them with relatively few. But I only need a few--six or eight, as you pointed out, or something like that. It would be better for you--it certainly would have been better for you if we had had the insights about what we regard as the more complicated businesses you describe--because there was and may still be a chance to make a whole lot more money if those growth rates that you describe are maintained. I don't think you'll find better managers than Andy Grove at Intel or Bill Gates at Microsoft and they certainly seem to have fantastic positions in the businesses they're in, but I don't know enough about those businesses to be sure that those businesses are fantastic as I am about being sure that Gillette and Coca-Cola's businesses are fantastic. You may understand those businesses better than you understand Coke and Gillette because of your background or just the way your mind is wired. But I don't, and therefore I have to stick with what I really think I can understand.---------------------------------------------------We favor businesses where we really think we know the answer. If we think the business’s competitive position is shaky, we won’t try to compensate with price. We want to buy a great business, defined as having a high return on capital for a long period of time, where we think management will treat us right. We like to buy at 40 cents on the dollar, but will pay a lot closer to $1 on the dollar for a great business.If we see someone who weighs 300 pounds or 320 pounds, it doesn’t matter – we know they’re fat. We look for fat businesses.We don’t get paid for the past, only the future profitability of a business. The past is only useful to give you insights into the future, but sometimes there’s no insight. At times, we’ve been able to buy businesses at one quarter of what they’re worth, but we haven’t seen that recently pause except South Korea. We know how to recognize and step over one-foot bars and recognize and avoid seven-foot bars.",1

125, What is the ideal business?,"The ideal business is one that generates very high returns on capital and can invest that capital back into the business at equally high rates. Imagine a $100 million business that earns 20% in one year, reinvests the $20 million profit and in the next year earns 20% of $120 million and so forth. But there are very very few businesses like this. Coke has high returns on capital, but incremental capital doesn't earn anything like its current returns. We love businesses that can earn high rates on even more capital than it earns. Most of our businesses generate lots of money, but can't generate high returns on incremental capital -- for example, See's and Buffalo News. We look for them areas to wisely reinvest capital, but they don't exist.So, what we do is take money and move it around into other businesses. The newspaper business earned great returns but not on incremental capital. But the people in the industry only knew how to reinvest it so they squandered a lot of capital. But our structure allows us to take excess capital and invest it elsewhere, wherever it makes the most sense. It's an enormous advantage.See's has produced $1 billion pre-tax for us over time. If we'd deployed that in the candy business, the returns would have been terrible, but instead we took the money out of the business and redeployed it elsewhere. Look at the results!We like to be able to move cash around and find it's best use. We'd love to have our companies redeploy cash, but they can't. Gillette has a great business, but can't sensibly reinvest all of the profit.We don't think the batting average of American industry redeploying capital has been very great. We knock other people doing what has made us so successful..",1
126, What makes a great business?,"The best businesses can maintain their earnings without continued reinvestment, whereas in the worst you have to keep pouring money into a money-losing business.The best business is being the best surgeon in town. You don’t have to do any reinvestment – the investment was the education. The surgeon will retain his earnings power, regardless of inflation.* * *Untapped pricing power. The measure of a great business.We like buying businesses with some untapped pricing power. For example, when we bought See’s for $25 million, I asked myself, “If we raised prices by 10 cents per pound, would sales fall off a cliff?” The answer was obviously no. You can determine the strength of a business over time by the amount of agony they go through in raising prices.A good example is newspapers. The local daily paper controlled the market and every year they raised the advertising rates and circulation prices – it was almost a big yawn. They didn’t worry about losing big advertisers like Sears, JC Penney or Wal-Mart, or losing subscribers. They increased prices whether the price of newsprint went up or down.Now, they agonize over price increases because they worry about driving people to other mediums. That world has changed.You can learn a lot about the durable economics of a business by watching price behavior. The beer industry is able to raise prices, but it’s getting tougher.",1
127," When you are looking at a business in which to invest, what are your priorities?","You have to really understand the economics of a business and the kind of people you are getting into business with. They have to love their business. They have to feel that they have been creative, that it is their painting, I am not going to disturb it, just give them more canvas and more brushes, but its their painting, from our standpoint any way. The whole place will reflect the attitude of the person at the top, if you have someone at the top who doesn’t care, the people down below won’t care. On the other hand, if you have someone at the top who cares a great deal, that will be evident across the organization. The type of people managing the business is a very important criteria, then? Yes, contracts don’t protect you; you have to have confidence in the people.---------------------------------------------------We want a business that we think, if run well, is going to have a competitive advantage. We don't buy hula hoop or pet rock companies, or companies with explosions in demand but we don't know who the winners will be.",1
128, What makes a company something that you like?,"I like businesses that I can understand. Let’s start with that. That narrows it down by 90%. There are all types of things I don’t understand, but fortunately, there is enough I do understand. You have this big wide world out there and almost every company is publicly owned. So you have all American business practically available to you. So it makes sense to go with things you can understand.I can understand this, anyone can understand this (Buffett holds up a bottle of Coca-Cola). Since 1886, it is a simple business, but it is not an easy business—I don’t want an easy business for competitors. I want a business with a moat around it. I want a very valuable castle in the middle and then I want the Duke who is in charge of that castle to be very honest and hard working and able. Then I want a moat around that castle. The moat can be various things: The moat around our auto insurance business, Geico, is low cost.People have to buy auto insurance so everyone is going to have one auto insurance policy per car basically. I can’t sell them 20, but they have to buy one. I can sell them 1. What are they going to buy it on? (based on what criteria?) They (customers) will buy based on service and cost. Most people will assume the service is identical among companies or close enough. So they will do it on cost. So I have to be a low cost producer--that is my moat. To the extent that my costs are further below the other guy, I have thrown a couple of sharks into the moat. All the time you have this wonderful castle, there are people out there who are going to attack it and try to take it away from you. I want a castle I can understand, but I want a castle with a moat around it.30 years ago, Eastman Kodak’s moat was just as wide as Coca-Cola’s moat. I mean if you were going to take a picture of your six-month old baby and you want to look at that picture 20 years from now or 50 years from now. And you are never going to get a chance—you are not a professional photographer—so you can evaluate what is going to look good 20 or 50 years ago. What is in your mind about that photography company (Share of Mind) is what counts. Because they are promising you that the picture you take today is going to be terrific 20 to 50 years from now about something that is very important to you. Well, Kodak had that in spades 30 years ago, they owned that. They had what I call share of mind. Forget about share of market, share of mind. They had something—that little yellow box—that said Kodak is the best. That is priceless. They have lost some of that. They haven’t lost it all.It is not due to George Fisher. George is doing a great job, but they let that moat narrow. They let Fuji come and start narrowing the moat in various ways. They let them get into the Olympics and take away that special aspect that only Kodak was fit to photograph the Olympics. So Fuji gets there and immediately in people’s minds, Fuji becomes more into parity with Kodak.You haven’t seen that with Coke; Coke’s moat is wider now than it was 30 years ago. You can’t see the moat day by day but every time the infrastructure that gets built in some country that isn’t yet profitable for Coke that will be 20 years from now. The moat is widening a little bit. Things are, all the time, changing a little in one direction or the other. Ten years from now, you will see the difference. Our managers of the businesses we run, I have one message to them, and we want to widen the moat. We want to throw crocs, sharks and gators—I guess—into the moat to keep away competitors. That comes about through service, through quality of product, it comes about through cost, some times through patents, and/or real estate location. So that is the business I am looking for.Now what kind of businesses am I going to find like that? Well, I am going to find them in simple products because I am not going to be able to figure what the moat is going to look like for Oracle, Lotus or Microsoft, ten years from now. Gates is the best businessman I have ever run into and they have a hell of a position, but I really don’t know what that business is going to look like ten years from now. I certainly don’t know what his competitors will look like ten years from now. I know what the chewing business will look like ten years from now. The Internet is not going to change how we chew gum and nothing much else is going to change how we chew gum. There will lots of new products. Is Spearmint or Juicy Fruit going to evaporate? It isn’t going to happen. You give me a billion dollars and tell me to go into the chewing gum business and try to make a real dent in Wrigley’s. I can’t do it. That is how I think about businesses. I say to myself, give me a billion dollars and how much can I hurt the guy? Give me $10 billion dollars and how much can I hurt Coca-Cola around the world? I can’t do it. Those are good businesses.Now give me some money and tell me to hurt somebody in some other fields, and I can figure out how to do it.So I want a simple business, easy to understand, great economics now, honest and able management, and then I can see about in a general way where they will be ten (10) years from now. If I can’t see where they will be ten years from now, I don’t want to buy it. Basically, I don’t want to buy any stock where if they close the NYSE tomorrow for five years, I won’t be happy owning it. I buy a farm and I don’t get a quote on it for five years and I am happy if the farm does OK. I buy an apartment house and don’t get a quote on it for five years, I am happy if the apartment house produces the returns that I expect. People buy a stock and they look at the price next morning and they decide to see if they are doing well or not doing well. It is crazy. They are buying a piece of the business. That is what Graham—the most fundamental part of what he taught me.You are not buying a stock, you are buying part ownership in a business. You will do well if the business does well, if you didn’t pay a totally silly price. That is what it is all about. You ought to buy businesses you understand. Just like if you buy farms, you ought to buy farms you understand. It is not complicated.Incidentally, by the way, in calling this Graham-Buffett, this is pure Graham. I was very fortunate. I picked up his book (The Intelligent Investor) when I was nineteen; I got interested in stocks when I was 6 or 7. I bought my first stock when I was eleven. But I was playing around with all this stuff—I had charts and volume and I was making all types of technical calculations and everything. Then I picked up a little book that said you are not just buying some little ticker symbol, that bounces around every day, you are buying part of a business. Soon as I started thinking about it that way, everything else followed. It is very simple. So we buy businesses we think we can understand. There is no one here who can’t understand Coke.If I was teaching a class at business school, on the final exam I would pass out the information on an Internet company and ask each student to value it. Anybody that gave me an answer, I’d flunk (Laughter). I don’t know how to do it. But people do it all the time; it is more exciting. If you look at it like you are going to the races--that is a different thing--but if you are investing. Investing is putting out money to be sure of getting more back later at an appropriate rate. And to do that you have to understand what you are doing at any time. You have to understand the business. You can understand some businesses but not all businesses.",1

130, What types of businesses have the highest ROIC?,"You could run Coca-Cola with no capital. There are a number of businesses that operate on negative capital. Great magazines operate with negative capital. Subscriptions are paid upfront, they have limited fixed investments. There are certain businesses like this. Blue Chip Stamps - it got float ahead of time. There are a lot of great businesses. Apple doesn’t need very much capital. See’s needs little capital but it can’t get that large -- we can’t get people eating 10 lbs of boxed chocolate every day. Great consumer businesses need relatively little capital. Where people pay you in advance (magazines, insurance), you are using your customers’ capital. But the rest of the world knows this and they get expensive. It can be competitive to buy them. Business Wire – it doesn’t require capital. Many service businesses require little capital. When successful, they can be something. If you could own one business in the world, what would it be?.

133, What have been your business mistakes?,"How much time do you have? The interesting thing about investments for me and my partner, Charlie Munger, the biggest mistakes have not been mistakes of commission, but of omission. They are where we knew enough about the business to do something and where, for one reason or another, sat they're sucking out thumbs instead of doing something. And so we have passed up things where we could have made billions and billions of dollars from things we understood, forget about things we don’t understand. The fact I could have made billions of dollars from Microsoft doesn’t mean anything because I never could understand Microsoft. But if I can make billions out of healthcare stocks, then I should make it. And I didn’t when the Clinton health care program was proposed and they all went in the tank. We should have made a ton of money out of that because I could understand it. And didn’t make it.I should have made a ton of money out of Fannie Mae back the mid-1980s, but I didn’t do it. Those are billion dollar mistakes or multi-billion dollar mistakes that generally accepted accounting principles don’t pick up. The mistakes you see. I made a mistake when I bought US Air Preferred some years ago. I had a lot of money around. I make mistakes when I get cash. Charlie tells me to go to a bar instead. Don’t hang around the office. But I hang around the office and I have money in my pocket, I do something dumb. It happens every time. So I bought this thing. Nobody made me buy it. I now have an 800 number I call every time I think about buying a stock in an airline. I say, “I am Warren and I am an air-aholic.” They try to talk me down, “Keep talking don’t do anything rash.” Finally I got over it. But I bought it. And it looked like we would lose all our money in it. And we came very close to losing all our money in it. You can say we deserved to lose our money it.We bought it because it was an attractive security. But it was not in an attractive industry. I did the same thing in Salomon. I bought an attractive security in a business I wouldn’t have bought the equity in. So you could say that is one form of mistake. Buying something because you like the terms, but you don’t like the business that well. I have done that in the past and will probably do that again. The bigger mistakes are the ones of omission. Back when I had $10,000 I put $2,000 of it into a Sinclair Service Station which I lost, so the opportunity cost on that money is about $6 billion right now--fairly big mistakes. It makes me feel good when my Berkshire goes down, because the cost of my Sinclair Station goes down too. My 20% opportunity cost. I will say this, it is better to learn from other people’s mistakes as much as possible. But we don’t spend any time looking back at Berkshire. I have a partner, Charlie Munger; we have been pals for forty years—never had an argument. We disagree on things a lot but we don’t have arguments about it.We never look back. We just figure there is so much to look forward to that there is no sense thinking of what we might have done. It just doesn’t make any difference. You can only live life forward. You can learn something perhaps from the mistakes, but the big thing to do is to stick with the businesses you understand. So if there is a generic mistake outside your circle of competence like buying something that somebody tips you on or something of the sort. In an area you know nothing about, you should learn something from that which is to stay with what you can figure out yourself. You really want your decision making to be by looking in the mirror. Saying to yourself, “I am buying 100 shares of General Motors at $55 because.” It is your responsibility if you are buying it. There’s gotta be a reason and if you can’t state the reason, you shouldn’t buy it. If it is because someone told you about it at a cocktail party, not good enough. It can’t be because of the volume or a reason like the chart looks good. It has to be a reason to buy the business. That we stick to pretty carefully. That is one of the things Ben Graham taught me.---------------------------------------------------If we start buying a stock, we want to go in heavy. I can't think of a stock where we wanted to quit.We've made some big mistakes starting to buy something that was cheap and within our circle of competence, but trickled off because price went up a bit. Good ideas are too scarce to be parsimonious with.--------------------------------------------------The main mistakes we’ve made – some of them big time – are: 1) Ones when we didn’t invest at all, even when we understood it was cheap; and 2) Starting in on an investment and not maximizing it.Charlie is a big fan of doing things on a big scale. But when I bought something at X and it went up to X and 1/8th, I sometimes stopped buying, perhaps hoping it would come back down. We’ve missed billions when I’ve gotten anchored.. Do you have anything worse to confess than Wal-Mart?I cost us about $10 billion. I set out to buy 100 million sharers, pre-split, at $23. We bought a little and it moved up a bit and I stopped buying. Perhaps I thought it might come back a bit – who knows? That thumb-sucking, the reluctance to pay a little more, cost us a lot. There are other examples.On the other hand, it doesn’t bother us. If every shot you hit in golf was a hole-in-one, you’d lose interest. You gotta hit a few in the woods.We probably won’t make the kind of mistake that costs us a lot – though we did with Dexter Shoes. We’re more likely to make mistakes of omission, not commission, in the future.. Since mistakes of omission don’t appear in the financial statements, most people don’t pay attention to them. We rub our noses in mistakes of omission – as we just did.",1
134, How do you determine what is the proper price to pay for the business?,"It is a tough thing to decide but I don’t want to buy into any business I am not terribly sure of. So if I am terribly sure of it, it probably won’t offer incredible returns. Why should something that is essentially a cinch to do well, offer you 40% a year? We don’t have huge returns in mind, but we do have in mind not losing anything. We bought See’s Candy in 1972, See’s Candy was then selling 16 m. pounds of candy at a $1.95 a pound and it was making 2 bits a pound or $4 million pre-tax. We paid $25 million for it—6.25 x pretax or about 10x after tax. It took no capital to speak of. When we looked at that business—basically, my partner, Charlie, and I—we needed to decide if there was some untapped pricing power there. Where that $1.95 box of candy could sell for $2 to $2.25. If it could sell for $2.25 or another $0.30 per pound that was $4.8 on 16 million pounds. Which on a $25 million purchase price was fine. We never hired a consultant in our lives; our idea of consulting was to go out and buy a box of candy and eat it.What we did know was that they had share of mind in California. There was something special. Every person in Ca. has something in mind about See’s Candy and overwhelmingly it was favorable. They had taken a box on Valentine’s Day to some girl and she had kissed him. If she slapped him, we would have no business. As long as she kisses him, that is what we want in their minds. See’s Candy means getting kissed. If we can get that in the minds of people, we can raise prices. I bought it in 1972, and every year I have raised prices on Dec. 26th, the day after Christmas, because we sell a lot on Christmas. In fact, we will make $60 million this year. We will make $2 per pound on 30 million pounds. Same business, same formulas, same everything--$60 million bucks and it still doesn’t take any capital.And we make more money 10 years from now. But of that $60 million, we make $55 million in the three weeks before Christmas. And our company song is: “What a friend we have in Jesus.” (Laughter). It is a good business. Think about it a little. Most people do not buy boxed chocolate to consume themselves, they buy them as gifts— somebody’s birthday or more likely it is a holiday. Valentine’s Day is the single biggest day of the year. Christmas is the biggest season by far. Women buy for Christmas and they plan ahead and buy over a two or three week period. Men buy on Valentine’s Day. They are driving home; we run ads on the Radio. Guilt, guilt, guilt—guys are veering off the highway right and left. They won’t dare go home without a box of Chocolates by the time we get through with them on our radio ads. So that Valentine’s Day is the biggest day.Can you imagine going home on Valentine’s Day—our See’s Candy is now $11 a pound thanks to my brilliance. And let’s say there is candy available at $6 a pound. Do you really want to walk in on Valentine’s Day and hand—she has all these positive images of See’s Candy over the years—and say, “Honey, this year I took the low bid.” And hand her a box of candy. It just isn’t going to work. So in a sense, there is untapped pricing power—it is not price dependent.Think of Disney. Disney is selling Home Videos for $16.95 or $18.95 or whatever. All over the world—people, and we will speak particularly about Mothers in this case, have something in their mind about Disney. Everyone in this room, when you say Disney, has something in their mind about Disney. When I say Universal Pictures, if I say 20th Century Fox, you don’t have anything special in your mind. Now if I say Disney, you have something special in your mind. That is true around the world.Now picture yourself with a couple of young kids, whom you want to put away for a couple of hours every day and get some peace of mind. You know if you get one video, they will watch it twenty times. So you go to the video store or wherever to buy the video. Are you going to sit there and premier 10 different videos and watch them each for an hour and a half to decide which one your kid should watch? No. Let’s say there is one there for $16.95 and the Disney one for $17.95—you know if you take the Disney video that you are going to be OK. So you buy it. You don’t have to make a quality decision on something you don’t want to spend the time to do. So you can get a little bit more money if you are Disney and you will sell a lot more videos. It makes it a wonderful business. It makes it very tough for the other guy.How would you try to create a brand—Dreamworks is trying—that competes with Disney around the world and replaces the concept that people have in their minds about Disney with something that says, Universal Pictures? So a mother is going to walk in and pick out a Universal Pictures video in preference to a Disney. It is not going to happen.Coca-Cola is associated with people being happy around the world. Everyplace – Disneyland, the World Cup, the Olympics—where people are happy. Happiness and Coke go together. Now you give me—I don’t care how much money—and tell me that I am going to do that with RC Cola around the world and have five billion people have a favorable image in their mind about RC Cola. You can’t get it done. You can fool around, you can do what you want to do. You can have price discounts on weekends. But you are not going to touch it. That is what you want to have in a business. That is the moat. You want that moat to widen.If you are See’s Candy, you want to do everything in the world to make sure that the experience basically of giving that gift leads to a favorable reaction. It means what is in the box, it means the person who sells it to you, because all of our business is done when we are terribly busy. People come in during theose weeks before Chirstmas, Valentine’s Day and there are long lines. So at five o’clock in the afternoon some woman is selling someone the last box candy and that person has been waiting in line for maybe 20 or 30 customers. And if the salesperson smiles at that last customer, our moat has widened and if she snarls at ‘em, our moat has narrowed. We can’t see it, but it is going on everyday. But it is the key to it. It is the total part of the product delivery. It is having everything associated with it say, See’s Candy and something pleasant happening. That is what business is all about.",1

I asked him for examples of this bad businesses turning into good businesses over the past 100 years and he couldn't name very many.Sometimes businesses have problems, but haven't lost their competitive advantages. When GEICO had problems in the mid-1970s, the model wasn't broken.One example: Pepsi lost its edge post-WW II when costs went up, but they successfully changed. To some extent Gillette lost its competitive edge in the 1930s to penny blades, but then regained it.But generally speaking, when a company loses its edge, it's very difficult to regain. Packard cars went downscale one year and never regained its upscale image. Department stores have done this. You can always juice sales by going down market, but it's hard to go back up market.",1

139, Please talk about the shift to investing in capital intensive business and the ultimate impact on intrinsic value. Help us understand the time value of the necessary capital expenditures.,"It’s clear you understand the question well, and it as important a question as you can ask. We are putting big money in big businesses with good economics, but not as good as when we were dealing with smaller amounts. $40m of capital required in See’s and it earns much more than that. If we could put in more we would. But wonderful businesses don’t soak up capital – we had $2.2b operating earnings in Q1. We have to put it out as intelligently as we can. When we find them, we’ll buy them. Can we put it to work intelligently? We think capital intensive businesses we have bought are good, working well. But it can’t work brilliantly, we can’t spend all that money and still get high returns. But does that mean we should pay out excess capital instead? No, because we think they can earn a good return even with the need to make capital investments in certain businesses. We are better paying it out only if we can’t translate it into more than $1 of present value. In our judgment with BNSF we did it, but scorecard will only come in 10 to 20 yrs. In MidAmerican, we have done it. But it won’t be a Coca-Cola – which doesn’t need as much capital. I hope we don’t disappoint you. If anyone expects brilliant returns from this base at Berkshire, we don’t know how to do it. I’m just as good at not knowing as you are.",1

What might we learn from this?","I'm not an expert on these companies, but my understanding is that Kellogg pushed their pricing too far. They didn't have to moat they thought they had versus General Mills and other major competitors. Campbell's problems are more related to lifestyle changes of Americans. Soup fits in a little less well than it did 40 years ago.With soft drinks, there has been no decrease in demand for decades. 30% of liquid consumption of Americans is soda and 40% of that is Coke products, so 1/8th of U.S. liquid consumption is Coke products.Coffee and milk consumption has been declining every year -- it's clear where preferences go once people start drinking soda.These trends are almost impossible not to happen in developing countries, where the consumption of Coke products is 1/50th what it is in the U.S. -- though Coke could screw it up by pricing too high.Coke has also benefited from its relative price. Since 1930, its cost per ounce has only doubled. This very low price inflation has contributed to the increase in per capita consumption.There is always a battle between the retailers and manufacturers of branded products. In the 1930s, A&P had its own line of branded products that did very well. It would be interesting to know what happened.",1
144, What's your opinion of downsizing and outsourcing?,"Whether or not such actions are necessary depends on the industry: if it’s a growing industry, you don’t need such measures. If there’s not enough growth in an industry to support all of the players, it’s in society’s best interests to have the most output produced with the least inputs - but society needs to help those who find themselves on the outside. “I believe this has been more of a media story than a real news story,” Buffett explained. “I don’t believe there’s a greater percentage of people displaced as a percentage of the work force than there was ten years ago.”Munger’s take on the situation: “I can’t name a firm that was harmed by over-downsizing. I can rattle off name after name of ones that were ruined by bloat. It’s fashionable to say downsizing is wrong: I think it’s wrong that the firms got in such a state that they needed downsizing.back to the questions.(https://buffettfaq.com/#questions)Our carpet business has been hit by rising commodity prices. Sometimes you can get into temporary situations in which you can’t raise prices fast enough to keep up with rising input costs. But the main impact of the rising price of oil – it’s an extra $200 million per day – is borne by American consumers.Corporate profits are at an all-time high as a percentage of GDP. I’d bet that they go down in the next few years. Corporate taxes as a percent of total taxes are at an all-time low and there’s likely to be reversion to the mean.",1

146, Could you explain a little more about the mind of the consumer and the nature of the product?  And explain how you actually apply these concepts to find the companies with the best potential?,"When you get into consumer products, you're really interested in thinking about what is in the mind of how many people throughout the world think about a product now, and what is likely to be in their mind 5 or 10 or 20 years from now.  Now virtually every person around the globe (maybe 75% of people) have some function in their mind about Coca-Cola. The name Coca-Cola means something to them. You know, RC Cola doesn't mean something to virtually anyone in the world. Well, it does to the guy who owns RC, but everybody has something in their mind about Coca-Cola, and overwhelmingly it's favorable. It's associated with pleasant experiences. Now part of that is that by this time, Coca-Cola is found where you are happy, it is at Disneyworld, it's at ballparks, every place you're likely to have a smile on your face, including the Berkshire Hathaway meeting I might add. (laughter) And that position in the mind is pretty firmly established, and it's established in close to 200 countries around the world. A year from now, it will be established in more minds and will have a slightly different overall position. In 10 years, the position will change just a little bit more. It's share of mind, not share of market that counts.Disney, same way--Disney means something to billions of people. If you're a parent with a couple of young children, and you've got 50 videos that you can buy, you're not going to sit down and preview an hour and a half of each video before deciding which one to stick in front of your kids. And you've got something in mind about Disney that you don't have about ABC Video Company, or you don't even have about 20th Century, and you don't have about Paramount. That name to billions of people has a meaning, and that meaning is overwhelmingly favorable, reinforced by the other activities of the company. Just think what someone would pay to buy that share of mind. You can't do it. You can't do it by a billion dollar advertising budget, or a 3 billion dollar advertising budget, or by hiring a twenty thousand supersalesmen. So you've got that. Now the question is what does that stand for 5 or 10 or 20 years from now. You know there'll be more people, you know there'll be more people familiar with Disney, and you know that there will always be parents who are interested in having something for their kids to do and that kids will love the same sort of things.  That's what you're trying to think about with a consumer products company.That's what Charlie and I were thinking about when we bought See's Candy. Who's face lights up on Valentine's Day when you hand them a box of candy from some nondescript company and you say, ""Here, honey, I took the low bid?"" You have many millions of people who got handed a box of See's candy and it wasn't that much thereafter that they got kissed for the first time. So the memories are good, the associations are good. A position in the mind is what counts in a consumer product. But it's a total process.a very good product may need tons of infrastructure. I had a case of Cherry Coke waiting for me at the Great Wall of China. You've got to have the product there when people want it. In World War II, General Eisenhower said to Mr. Woodruff that he wanted a Coca-Cola within arm's length of every American servicemen in the world, and they built a lot of bottling plants to take care of that. That sort of positioning can be incredible. It seems to work especially well for American products. People want certain American products worldwide.our music, our movies, our soft drinks, our fast food. I can't imagine a French firm, or a German firm, or a Japanese firm selling 48% of the world's soft drinks. It's part of American culture and the world hungers for it. Kodak, for example, somehow does not have the same place in the world's mind now that it did 20 years ago.Fuji pushed their way to more parity with Kodak. You don't want to ever let them do that. That's why you can see a Coca-Cola or a Disney doing things that you think, well this doesn't make a whole lot of sense, that if they didn't spend this $10 million, wouldn't they still sell just as much Coca-Cola. You don't know which dollar is doing it, but you do know that virtually everybody in the world has heard of your product and has a favorable impression of it. With See's Candy, we're no better than the last customer who's been served their candy, but as long as we do the job on that, people can't catch us. We can charge a little more for it because people are not interested in taking the low bidder. Private labels stalled out in the soft drink business, because people want the Real Thing..  If we hadn't have bought See's, we wouldn't have bought Coca-Cola in 1988, so you have give See's a significant part of the credit for the $11 billion plus profit we've got in Coca-Cola at the present time.",1

149, How do you grow a small business into a big business?,"Berkshire was a small business at one time. It just takes time. It is the nature of compound interest. You can’t build it in one day, or one week. Charlie and I never tried to do a masterstroke to convert Berkshire into something four times bigger. We just consistently kept doing what we understood and, if you have fun doing it, then it’ll be something quite large at some point. Nothing magical. It would be nice to multiply money in a few weeks. In a general way, we have done the same things for years. We will have more businesses in a few years - some will do worse, but most will do better. It is an automatic formula for getting ahead, but not galloping. We are happy not doing anything at all. As Gypsy Rose Lee said, ‘I have everything I had before, just two inches lower.’ laughter We want everything in two years to be higher. We went into the muni bond insurance business. Ajit got the company up, licensed and running. In Q1’08, our premium volume was $400 million. Our volume was bigger than anyone else, and I wouldn’t be surprised if it was bigger than all the rest combined. They did 278 transactions. All done in an office with 29 or 30 people. One of the interesting things about it was that almost all the business was from people who already had insurance from others who are rated AAA. So we pay out only if the muni defaulted AND the bond insurer didn’t pay. We wrote for 2.25% when the original guy charged 1%. This tells you something about AAA in bond insurance in 2008. Ajit has done a remarkable job. We wrote a couple policies for Detroit sewers, and people have found these bonds trading at a better price than others only insured by other bond in- surers. I congratulate Ajit for it.",1

152, Your opinion on derivatives?,"2003 - Re: pre-releasing part of the annual letter in Fortune I was interested in the section on derivatives -- I thought it had a broader audience. It had no relation to Berkshire directly. The primary reason is that I hoped for a wider audience.Charlie and I think that there is a low but not insignificant probability that at some time -- I don't know when; it could be three years, it could be 20 years -- derivatives could lead to a major problem. The problem grows as derivatives get more complex. We hoped to give a mild wakeup call to the financial world that there's a problem. In the energy sector, derivatives destroyed or almost destroyed institutions that shouldn't have been destroyed. He mentioned Enron.Charlie and I would not know how to regulate it. We have some experience seeing specific dangers in that field and some insight into systemic problems that can arise. People don't want to think about it until it happens, but it is best thought about before it happens.It's a low probability, but we think a lot about low probability events. We have some experience with Salomon and Gen Re. Charlie saw some things on Salomon's audit committee that were very risky/questionable.. In engineering, people have a big margin of safety. But in the financial world, people don't give a damn about safety. They let it balloon and balloon and balloon. It's aided by false accounting. I'm more pessimistic than Warren. I'll be amazed if we don't have some kind of significant blowup in next 5-10 years.Derivatives are advertised as shedding risk for the system, but they have long crossed the point of decreasing risk and now increase risk. The truth is that Coca Cola could handle risk I think he was talking about currency exposure, but now with every company transferring risk to very few players, they are all hugely interdependent. Central banks are exposed to weaknesses. If Salomon had failed, the problems for the rest of the system could have been quite significant. When you start concentrating risk in institutions that are highly leveraged, watch out. They have big trading departments with people who make a lot of money.It's not a prediction, it's a warning.---------------------------------------------------We don’t think that in any year the chance is very high that derivatives will lead to or greatly accentuate a financial trauma, but we think it’s there.It’s fascinating to look at a company like Freddie Mac: an institution that dozens of financial analysts were looking at; that had an oversight office; that was created by Congress with committees to oversee it; that had two smart, exceptional board members, Marty Leibowitz(http://www.freddiemac.com/news/archives/investors/2002/board_1205.html) and Henry Kaufman(http://www.theglobalist.com/DBWeb/AuthorBiography.aspx?AuthorId=126); and that had auditors present – yet Freddie misstated earnings by $6 billion in a short time. That’s big money. And a large part of it was facilitated by derivatives. You can go back and read the footnotes, listen to the conference calls, etc. and you wouldn’t have known. In the end, it was $6 billion, but it could have been $12 billion if they’d wanted.Derivatives can lead to a lot of mischief. When you have a complicated derivative transaction, and a trader with investment house A on one side and investment house B on the other side, and on the day the deal is done, both record a profit, this can lead to mischief – and the scale is getting bigger every day.I know the managements of many large financial institutions and they don’t have their minds around this. We tried at Gen Re where we had a small derivative book and couldn’t.Whatever problems there were at Salomon during its crisis years ago, they’re far, far worse now systemwide.In 1991, if the government hadn’t reversed himself in its plans to take actions that would have put Salomon out of business, we were preparing documents to file for bankruptcy. Had this happened, We had $1.2 trillion notional value of derivative contracts that others were counting on, that would have gone bad. All sorts of securities transactions wouldn’t have settled, accounts in Japan and the UK would have been affected, etc. For instance, Salomon had a relationship with a bank in Germany which took large deposits in Germany and lent the money to Salomon. All kinds of things would have come out. You don’t need to put these strains on a system that’s already highly leveraged.When you get huge amounts of transactions, which not many people understand, you create a huge problem that may be triggered by an exogenous event.We use derivatives – we get them collateralized – and we’ve made money on them. But I predict that sometime in the next 10 years, we will have a big problem caused by or exaggerated by derivatives.If you want to have a little fun, go to the annual meeting of a big financial company and ask about the details of a complex transaction. They won’t know – but you can be sure the trader who did it will be well paid for it.Any time you have situation where smart people can make money by taking risk, you’ll get it.Derivatives were supposed to spread risk, and some make that argument today. This may be true much of the time, but what about when risk becomes highly concentrated in a few institutions? Coke is better able to take currency risk than most trading desks. Overall, there’s much more risk in the system because of derivatives.* * *In response to a shareholder who compared super cat reinsurance risk to derivative risk, Buffett responded:The derivative contracts that Gen Re wrote are not similar to the super cat insurance we’re writing. We’re reinsuring personal or business risks others don’t want to or are unable to bear. In our view, it made no sense to be in the derivatives business.. They’re radically different. Derivatives are full of clauses that say if one party’s credit gets downgraded, then they have to put up collateral. It’s like margin – you can go broke. In attempting to protect themselves, they’ve introduced instability. Nobody seems to have recognition of what a disaster of a system they’ve created. It’s a demented system.Had Berkshire not bought Gen Re, which was rated AAA, it could have run into terrible financial difficulty post-9/11, especially if they’d recognized their actual liabilities. They would have been downgraded, which could have triggered things in derivative activities which would have triggered coming up with loads of cash.The system wasn’t built to last. Many CEOs at major financial institutions don’t really comprehend that. When you get margin calls for huge amounts of money, it only has to be one day when you can’t meet it and you can be forced to file for bankruptcy. In 1987, there was a large wire transfer that was late arriving at a Chicago brokerage house, and it came close to unraveling the system (the money finally showed up).---------------------------------------------------Q - How dangerous are derivatives to the financial system and what can be done to mitigate potential damage from them?We’ve tried to mitigate it raise warning flags about the dangers of derivatives a little by talking about it, but realize there is nothing inherently evil about derivatives. We have at least 60 of them and will be discussing them at our upcoming Berkshire board meeting.Derivatives are expanding rapidly, in more and more imaginative ways. They introduce invisible leverage into the system. In the 1930s, after the crash, the government concluded that leverage contributed to the crash and that it was dangerous. So the U.S. government empowered regulators to deal with this. For decades, they policed it and it was taken seriously when the Fed increased or decreased margin requirements.But the introduction of derivatives has made any regulation of margin requirements a joke. The regulation still exists, but it’s an anachronism.I believe that we may not know when it becomes a super danger or when it will end precisely, but I believe it will go on and increase until very unpleasant things happen because of it.You saw one example of what can happen under forced sales in October 1987. It was driven by portfolio insurance, which was a joke. It was a bunch of stop/loss orders, but done automatically, and it was merchandized. People paid a lot of money for people to teach them how to put in a stop/loss order. When a lot of institutions do this, the effect is pouring gas on a fire. They created a doomsday machine that kept selling and selling.You can have the same thing today because you have fund operators with billions of dollars – in aggregate, trillions of dollars – who will all respond to the same stimulus. It’s a crowded trade, but they don’t know it and it’s not formal. They will sell for the same reasons. Someday, you will get a very chaotic situation.As for what could trigger this and when, who knows? Who had any idea that shooting an archduke would start Word War I?. When we went to close out Gen Re’s derivatives book, we took a $400 million loss on a portfolio that was “marked to market” by the prior management and auditors – and I’m not criticizing our auditor. Any auditor would have said the same. I wish I could have sold to the auditors instead!Take a dry cleaning business that owes $15. Their books show a $15 accounts payable and the other company shows an offsetting $15 accounts receivable. But there are only four big auditing firms, so in many cases, if they’re auditing my side, the same firm may be valuing or attesting to the value of what’s on the books of the person on the other side. I will guarantee you that if you add up the marks on both sides, they don’t add up to zero. We have 60 or more derivative contracts, and I’ll bet the other side isn’t valuing them like we are. I have no reason to mark the value up – we don’t get paid for that. If I value it at $1 million on our side, the other side should be marking it at minus $1 million, but I guarantee the numbers are widely different. Auditors should check both sides of derivative trades and the “marks” should sum to about zero. They don’t. As sure as God made little green apples, this will cause a lot of trouble.

154, What are your views on derivatives and how do you think they have affected the global market?,"In my 2002 letter to shareholders I referred to them as “weapons of mass destruction.” Derivatives are really just a way to create a product with a very long fuse, for example, 100 years, as opposed to stocks which settle in 3 days. That kind of system allows claims to be built up. AIG called me in September and told me they were about to get downgraded which would have required higher posting requirements. Now this is an enterprise that has been built up over decades and was effectively destroyed in 48 hours by these products. With derivatives, you’re exposed to counterparties and thus reliant on others. These claims built up over time to the tune of billions of dollars and when one falls, the whole system falls. Derivatives are not evil by themselves but rather everyone needs to be able to handle them. System wide, they’re rat poison. Berkshire holds many derivatives but we always hold the money at Berkshire.---------------------------------------------------Q: Given the large amount of value that’s been destroyed by the use of derivatives, is it appropriate for Berkshire to hold large derivative positions?. Yes, derivatives pose problems to the world. Our job is to make money over time, and our use of derivatives doesn’t impinge on Berkshire’s capital — we have posted collateral of less than 1% of our total marketable securities. I said in 2002 that we use them. We think that as long as we explain our use of derivatives, the benefits outweigh the costs. We received $4.9 billion in premiums for writing equity puts and can use this money for 15 – 20 years. I personally think that we’ll make money on our equity put options. We’d have to lose money over 15 – 20 years to lose on our equity puts. We had a financial hurricane, yet regarding the equity put contracts, there’s a good chance we’ll make money on those. During the last week we modified two put contracts—reducing the term to about 10 years and reducing the strike price from 1,514 to 994. Our shareholders are intelligent enough to understand the situation if we explain it. It doesn’t make any sense that the tax treatment on gambling on S&P 500 contracts is better (partial long term capital gains treatment) than buying and holding individual stocks for less than a year (SP500 contract is taxed 60% long-term gain and 40% short term, even if you hold it for 60 seconds). This distortion came about as a result of the power of a small group of lobbyists. Charlie do you know why this is?. It is neither fair nor sensible. The idea that the tax treatment on something that is held for 3 seconds is different than something that is held for less than a year (some long term gains treatment for the former and none for the latter) is insane. If someone with money and interest cares a lot and others are indifferent, that someone wins in front of the legislative bodies. As Bismarck said, don’t watch sausage making or law making.",1

156, What's your opinion of stock options?,"If can lead to extremely capricious compensation results that have no link to a person's results.A CEO could simply put money in the bank and grow the business, so there should be a cost of capital factor built into any compensation plan. Also, options should not be issued when the stock is below intrinsic value.Well-fed CEOs are descending on Washington to persuade your Congressmen not to require expensing of options because they'd get less. It's sort of shameful.All of the opposition to options comes from people who would get fewer of them. If there was a rule saying the CEO's salary didn't count as an expense and there was a proposal to rescind this rule, you can bet they'd be in there fighting to keep the status quo.Q: Wouldn't expensing stock options be double counting, since they're already factored into the diluted share count?No. When you issue options at the market price, there's no dilution until the stock rises, but diluted and basic shares are the same.I don't have any objection to options under certain conditions -- I just think they should be recorded as an expense.We'll take options from certain companies in lieu of cash as payment for insurance -- even 10-year, 50% out-of-the-money options.""Look at Dell. They're buying and selling millions of options, but at the same time people are saying companies don't know how to value them. It's specious. A disconnect.I can figure out what I'd pay for an option on a private business, a public company, an apartment house, a farm, etc. EVERY option has value. People that get them understand this better than those that give them.We don't blindly use Black-Scholes; we apply judgment.We would pay something for just about any option.. ""Black-Scholes works for short-term options, but if it's a long-term option and you think you know something about the underlying asset, it's insane to use Black-Scholes.""Companies will do everything they can to reduce the value of options they grant. We've sat in on these meetings. They assume that options have a shorter life than they really do, etc.--------------------------------------------------Charlie and I have thought about options all of our life. My guess is that Charlie was thinking about this in grade school. You don't have to understand Black-Scholes at all, but you have to understand the utility and value of options, and cost of issuing them -- a very unpopular topic in some quarters.Let's say you sold a house and you asked for an option on the future appreciation of the house. Wouldn't you say that this option had value?Any option has value, and that's why some people who are kind of slick in business matters get options for nothing or little -- far less than market value. The Black-Scholes model is an attempt to measure market value of options. It cranks in various variables, mainly past volatility of the asset involved, which are not the best judge of value. For example, Berkshire had a very low beta -- experts like to give complex Greek names to simple things -- but that doesn't mean the option value to anyone who understood it was lower than another stock with higher volatility.As Charlie said, Black-Scholes can give silly results over longer term. Last year, we made one large commitment in which somebody on the other side was using Black-Scholes and we made $120 million. We love the idea of someone else using mechanistic formulas. They may be right 99% of the time, but we can pass 99 times and only invest the one time they're wrong.We like this kind of insanity. We will pay you real money if you deliver someone to our office who is willing to offer us three-year options that we can pick and choose from.Options have value. We issued them last year when we sold $400M of bonds. We knew what we were giving up -- it had a negative coupon, but options have value.They other companies pay people with options, whereas we pay with cash bonuses. We'd love to not record this expense. Why the opposition? Some people CEOs care a lot. They argue that the cost of options is included in the footnotes of the 10-K, to which I say why not pull all expenses in footnotes? Then you could just have two lines on the income statement: sales and the same amount on the next line, profits.It's amazing what people with high IQs will do for money. Charlie has a theory that it's more than money -- that it's driven by pride.The auditors swing back and forth. Now four firms the Big Four accounting firms that lobbied against options as an expense in 1993 are on the other side. I don't know how this could be options were not an expense then, but are now, but I'm happy to see it.---------------------------------------------------Congress has no business legislating accounting. It was a disgrace when Congress 10 years ago effectively bludgeoned Arthur Leavitt into backing down on expensing stock options, at the behest of big corporate contributors. In a very significant way, this accelerated the accounting abuses of the late 1990s.The Senate voted 88-9 to say that it’s more important to have stock prices go up than to have accurate expenses. All of the big auditing firms endorsed their big clients’ views, so they could report higher earnings. They the auditing firms have now shifted completely and support expensing options.The compromise was the firms were given the choice of expensing options or showing their cost in the footnotes – and 498 of the S&P 500 companies chose the latter.I suggest that you write to your Congressmen and tell them that FASB knows more about acting than they do.In Google, type in “Indiana” and “pi” and you’ll find a site here’s one(http://www.urbanlegends.com/legal/pi_indiana.html) that relates how, in 1897, the Indiana state legislature voted to round pi to 3.20 because it’s an easier number to work with. It passed the Indiana House, but by the time it got to the Senate, a few people managed to get it shot down.In 1993, the U.S. Senate cleansed the record of the Indiana House by changing the rules on something they knew nothing about stock options. 88 senators declared the world was flat because big donors said it was thus.",1

158, Would you use stock options to enter a position in a public company?,"If you want to buy or sell a stock, you should buy or sell a stock. We sold puts on Coca-Cola once, but usually it is best to just buy stock. Using option technique is an idea where you get to buy a stock cheap. Four out of five times you may get it right and one time you may miss the opportunity to buy. We virtually have never used options to enter or exit a position. We have sold long-term equity put options described in our press release. We don’t get involved in fancy techniques. A University of Chicago Graduate student asked me once, what are we being taught that is wrong? In business school the amount of time spent teaching option pricing is total nonsense. You only need two courses, (1) how to value a business, and (2) how to think about stock market fluctuations. The thing is that instructors know the formulas and you don’t, so they have something to fill the time. It has nothing to do with investment success—what matters is buying businesses at the right price. If you were teaching Biblical studies and you could read the Bible forward, backward, and in four different languages, you would find it hard to tell everyone that it comes down to the Ten Commandments. The priests want to spend a lot of time preaching. You must have an attitude where you aren’t influenced by the market. You need a mind- set, and you need to have the attitude to divorce your- self from letting the market influence you.",1

People say it’s a hedge against inflation, but that’s also true of oil, land, Coca-Cola, See’s Candies, etc. I’d much prefer to own land in Nebraska or an apartment house or an index fund as a store of value. We’d rather own an asset that will be useful even if the currency drops to 10 cents on the dollar. People will always need to drink and eat referring to Coke and See’s. We wouldn’t trade ownership of businesses for a hunk of yellow metal.* * *Gold would be way down my list as a store of value. I’d much rather own 100 acres of land in Nebraska or an apartment house or an index fund.The Dow went from 66 to 11,000 or 12,000 during the last century, and you got paid a lot of dividends along the way. Gold went from $20 in 1900 to $400 in 2000, plus you’d have to pay insurance and storage costs, so it’s not a good store of value.I’m not advocating paper money – it’s good to worry about this. But I’d rather sell one pound of candy. That will retain its value even if the currency is seashells.Gold has done very badly as an investment in the past and I see no reason why it will work well in the future. All that happens is that it is taken out of the ground in South Africa and put back in the ground in Fort Knox. (Laughter).

166, Experience with junk bonds?,"When we were buying junk bonds, we focused on ones we could understand. They were yielding 30%, 35%, 40% to maturity. We thought of them like equities.

We think more about big events in the financial arena than the natural arena.

Extraordinary things happened. Can these be the same people buying such bonds yielding 6% today who let them sink to such levels?Wall Street is awash in money and talent, but you get these absolutely extraordinary swings.

172, Investing in ethanol?,"Charlie and I do not know enough about the ethanol production business to evaluate it. We’ve been approached many times and they’re quite popular, but trying to figure out the economics of an ethanol plant will depend on government policy and a lot of other variables we’re not good at predicting. It’s also a very hot area for investors right now, and our general experience is that we don’t participate in things that are hot and easy to raise money for.I have a brother who’s on the ethanol board of Nebraska and if he becomes richer than me, I’ll reconsider my views on ethanol! LaughterThere’s no question that ethanol usage will grow. But generally speaking, agricultural processing – companies like Cargill and ADM Archer Daniels Midland – have not been great businesses and have not earned high returns on tangible capital. Ethanol could prove to be an exception, but I’m not sure how you gain a significant competitive advantage with any particular ethanol plant.---------------------------------------------------. Even McCain has had a counter-revelation: he’s decided ethanol is wonderful, now that he’s recognized that that’s how they think in Iowa. LaughterI think the idea of running vehicles on corn is one of the dumbest ideas I’ve ever seen. Governments, under pressure, do crazy things, but this is among the craziest. Raise the cost of food so you can run these autos around? You use up just about as much hydrocarbons making ethanol as it produces, and its cost doesn’t even factor in the permanent loss of topsoil. I love Nebraska to the core, but this was not my home state’s finest moment.back to the questions.(https://buffettfaq.com/#questions)I don’t think there’s a bubble in agricultural commodities like wheat, corn and soybeans. But in metals and oil there’s been a terrific price move. It’s like most trends: At the beginning, it’s driven by fundamentals, then speculation takes over. With copper there was a little shortage and then people got worried and then the price skyrocketed. As the old saying goes, “What the wise man does in the beginning, fools do in the end.” With any asset class that has a big move, first the fundamentals attract speculation, then the speculation becomes dominant.Once a price history develops and people hear that their neighbor made a lot of money on something, envy sets in and that impulse takes over. We’re seeing that in commodities – and housing as well. Orgies tend to be wildest toward the end.But you never know when it will end. The eyes of the world that never looked at silver at $1.60 are now looking at it. The price of silver today is around $14/oz. My guess today is that copper is responding more to speculative pressures than fundamentals..CM dripping with sarcasm: I think we’ve demonstrated our expertise in commodities, if you look at our activities in silver. LaughterI bought it very early and sold it very early. We made a few dollars. We’re not good at figuring out when a speculative game will end.It’s like Cinderella at the ball. At the start of the party, the punch is flowing and everything’s going well, but you know that at midnight everything’s going to turn back to pumpkins and mice. But you look around and say, ‘one more dance,’ and so does everyone else. Everyone thinks they’ll get out right at midnight.This is what’s happening with copper today, Internet stocks in 1999 and uranium stocks in the 1950s. The party does get to be more fun – and besides, there are no clocks on the wall. And then suddenly the clock strikes 12, and everything turns back to pumpkins and mice.We had a lot of silver at one time, but we don’t have it now. My original decision was that the production and reclamation of silver were running at 100 million ounces less than the consumption. Now a lot of consumption has gone down, for example in photography, but that’s where a lot of reclamation is as well, so it balances out. Silver was out of balance, but there’s now a lot above ground and a huge amount could be removed from other uses, which could increase supply, which is what happened when the Hunt brothers tried to corner the market in the early 1980s actually 1979-80.There are few pure silver mines – most silver is produced as a byproduct from other mining – so it’s not easy to bring on added production. I thought silver would get tight. I was early and sold early.To the questioner: You’re right that a commodity doesn’t earn anything, so unlike a company, in which earnings are accumulating every year, you have to sit with a commodity and hope for a shift in the supply and demand. It’s a big drawback.Well, we have a lot of to trumpet then! Laughter------------------------------------------------------RE: Investing in silverI’m not sure who we sold our silver too, but whoever bought it was a lot smarter than I was. I bought it too early and sold it too early, but other than that it was a perfect investment. Laughter Charlie had nothing to do with it – it was all me. When we bought it, we got a lot of letters about conspiracy theories of one sort or another. Silver responds to supply and demand, like any commodity, which is what determines its price (although the Hunt brothers changed that for a short while and regretted it).Q - Have you considered investing in metals to protect the company against inflation?We would not necessarily view metals investing as protection against inflation. The best protection is your own earnings power, whether the currency is in seashells or paper money. A first-class surgeon or teacher will do alright in terms of commanding the earning power of other people. The second best protection is owning a wonderful business, not metals or raw materials or minerals.The truth is, if you own Coca-Cola or Snickers bars or anything that people are going to want to give a portion of their current income to keep getting, and it has low capital-investment requirements, that’s the best investment you can possibly have in an inflationary world.But an inflationary world is not a good thing. We try to own good businesses. I think Berkshire wouldn’t do as well in real terms during periods of high rates of inflation vs. low rates, but we’d probably do better than most businesses.* * *We have no opinion on commodities. If we’re in an oil stock, it means we think it offers a lot of value at this price. If we think oil is going up, we could buy oil futures, which we did once.We think Posco is the best steel company in the world. When we bought it, it was at 4-5x earnings, had a debt-free balance sheet and was the low-cost producer.You can find some businesses with minimal capital investment. See’s Candy does not require much capital investment. It’s a small business, but a wonderful business – a far better business, adjusted for size, than any steel or oil business. We do everything we can to make it bigger.We do not have a bias toward any commodity-related business. If we have any bias, it’s against. We’re going to be investors in businesses, not commodities, and that has to work better over time.",1

178, What are your views on the dollar?,"My views on the likelihood of the dollar weakening are as strong as ever, perhaps a bit stronger. It’s almost certain that the U.S. currency will weaken over time as a result of the fiscal and monetary policies we’re currently following. I don’t know about the next six months, but certainly over time.We are doing less directly in currency futures because the carry costs have gone from positive to negative. In my view, there are considerably better ways to protect against the dollar getting weaker in the future. For example, we like to invest in companies, like Iscar, whose earnings are primarily in other currencies. We earn a lot of money in other currencies.Buffett read a quote about the dangers of running a large current-account deficit that ended, “Countries that have gone down this path inevitably run into trouble.” Guess who said that? Alan Greenspan. When he said that in 2002, the current account deficit was $385 billion. Now it’s double that. In his later years as Fed chairman, he didn’t emphasize this view as much, but he didn’t repudiate it either.It’s going to lead to trouble. People talk about a soft landing, but they don’t ever say how. Current Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said he expects a soft landing, but also said there’s the possibility of something worse.One possible outcome is significantly higher inflation. As you owe more and more, it’s tempting to devalue the currency in which the debts were incurred. Yes. I don’t see how people say it’s sustainable.The longer it goes on, the greater the net debt position builds up and the more people see it. And then something perhaps extraneous causes some big adjustments to take place and the result is chaos, in which currency adjustments play a part. But it’s impossible to predict this.Years ago, portfolio insurance was popular. People were selling this as a sophisticated way to manage money and mitigate risk – and they earned a lot selling it. Then October 19, 1987 came along. A relatively small portion of American investments were being guided by this doctrine, but just this small amount of money was the leading factor in a 22% one-day drop in the Dow. Everyone thought they were being reasonable, but they created a doomsday machine.I think the odds of something like this – though not this exactly – is magnified today compared to the 1980s. I don’t know who will yell fire, but when it happens, I’m sure the currency markets will play a role in the race for the door.",1
179, Early on in you career you bought some land and then rented this out to some local farmers? Why didn’t you pursue this type of investment in real estate?,"I made an initial investment farm real estate when I was 14. Someone else handled the whole transaction; I just bought 40 acres. A guy would farm the land and harvest X number bushels of soybean and sell if for $X per bushel at the market and say here is your check. I did virtually nothing for this investment. I had no idea if he actually harvested what he said he did, or if he sold the bushels he said he sold, or for that matter what price he sold it at. It’s kind of like the guys who kept all his cows in with a big herd. As they are taking them to market, the owner of the big herd says, sorry but all of your cows died. How would you know which cows were yours?In 1980 with the S&L crisis, land was selling for $2,000 an acre. Well, an acre produced 120 bushels of corn or 45 bushels of soybeans. At a couple dollars a bushel, this was basically $80 an acre in revenue. At the time with the interest rates, you would pay $150 per acre in interest. So you were taking in $80 and paying out $150, it just did not make sense. The bankers went crazy lending money at $2,000 an acre prices for farms at 10% interest rates to produce $80 an acre in crops. Well after a bunch of people lost big time, the FDIC took control of the farms and ended up selling them at $600 an acre, which at the time was a good deal. The FDIC took over hundreds of farms because people went crazy and lost their shirts.The S&L’s lost their fundamentals and the Government owned $100 million worth of properties they needed to dump at a low cost. This was an opportunity to make some money, however I still don’t like farms because they are too passive.I still don’t like farming. My son likes farming, I don’t.",1

181, What adjustments to reported earnings do you make?,"When goodwill was required to be amortized, we ignored amortization of goodwill and told our owners to ignore it, even though it was in GAAP Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. We felt that it was arbitrary.We thought crazy pension assumptions caused people to record phantom earnings. So, we're willing to tell you when we think there's data that is more useful than GAAP earnings.Not thinking of depreciation as an expense is crazy. I can think of a few businesses where one could ignore depreciation charges, but not many. Even with our gas pipelines, depreciation is real -- you have to maintain them and eventually they become worthless (though this may be 100 years).It depreciation is reverse float -- you lay out money before you get cash. Any management that doesn't regards depreciation as an expense is living in a dream world, but they're encouraged to do so by bankers. Many times, this comes close to a flim flam game.People want to send me books with EBITDA and I say fine, as long as you pay cap ex. There are very few businesses that can spend a lot less than depreciation and maintain the health of the business.This is nonsense. It couldn't be worse. But a whole generation of investors have been taught this. It's not a non-cash expense -- it's a cash expense but you spend it first. It's a delayed recording of a cash expense.We at Berkshire are going to spend more this year on cap ex than we depreciate.",1

185, What can be done to improve the accuracy of financial statements of financial institutions? What can be done to improve the integrity of financial statements?,"It is a very tough thing. I still lean strongly towards fair value accounting—it is hard to use, but should we use cost? I think there are more troubles when you start openly valuing things at prices that don’t matter instead of best estimates, even if inaccurate. I would stick with financials reporting assets at fair value. When you get into CDO-squared Collateralized Debt Obligation-Squared, the documentation is enormous. If you read a standard residential security prospectus it consists of thousands of mortgages, then different tranches. Then, you take a CDO and you take junior tranches on a whole bunch of juniors— put them together, and diversified in theory—a big error to start with. That was nuttiness squared. You had to read 15,000 pages to understand a CDO and 750,000 pages to evaluate one single security in a CDO-squared. To let people use the 100 cents they paid as the stated value versus the 10 cents it trades at in the market is an abomination. Fair value discipline, mild as it may be, may keep managements from doing some stupid things. I lean toward the market value approach. When you get towards complex instruments, I don’t know how you value it. Charlie, back at Salomon, I think you found one mismarked by $20 million, right?. A lot goes on in the bowels of American industry which is not pretty. A lot of people got overdosed on Ayn Rand. They would hold that even an axe murderer in a free market is a wise development. I think Alan Greenspan did a good job on average, but he overdosed on Ayn Rand, in that whatever happens in a free market is going to be all right. We should prohibit some things. If we had banned the phrase, “this is a financial innovation which will diversify risk,” we would have been far better off.back to the questions.(https://buffettfaq.com/#questions)We follow a policy of “criticize by practice, and praise by name.” You could say we hate the sin, but love the sinner. So I can’t really name names of companies that I think are doing this kind of thing; I’ve found that if you go around criticizing others, pretty soon the criticism comes back on you.. I don’t think they want names - I think she’s asking about the practice in general.That’s different, then. The practices relate to accounting charges, done to smooth out earnings and make future earnings look good. It has become totally fashionable among managements to play with the timing of expenses.Options expense recording has become optional as well; I haven’t seen tons of firms jumping on the chance to record stock compensation expense. And I think it’s deceptive to see it presented in the footnotes, the way it’s reported, because of the assumptions companies are using in valuing the options.The thinking of these executives goes like this: “ Why should I penalize my shareholders for not doing something that others will do to help theirs?” And the bad practices become the norm.---------------------------------------------------Let's not name names. Munich Re is a fine company. Our policy is that we compliment by name and criticize anonymously.

187, Where can you buy stock with the cheapest commissions?,"There are many places to buy stocks, and the commissions all vary. It is important in life to look not for what is cheapest, but where the most value is delivered. I suggest that you ask your parents if they can check some of them out with you. Maybe you can make a chart where you can compare the costs on one side, with the services offered on the other. It will be a good exercise, and whether you buy stocks or not, you will learn from the process.",1
188, How do you know when you are going to lose money and when you aren't? Since the stock market changes every minute.,"That is a very good question. The answer is you don’t know when you are going to make money or lose money. You are right, the stock market changes every minute. Because of that, you should never buy a stock expecting to make money in the short term. When you buy a stock, you are actually buying a share of that company. If it is a good company then you will make money over time as its value goes up. When you buy a stock, you need to imagine that the stock market will be closed for 20 years and you will not be able to look at its price. That way, you wont be distracted by the short term ups and downs. A company will be successful if it offers good products and services at a fair price while being run by honest, capable managers. Over the long run, such companies tend to appreciate and go up in value.",1
189, What's the role of the board of directors?,"I think big deals, on average in America, are contrary to shareholders’ interest.

I can’t ever think of a discussion when I was on a board of weighing what you’re giving away vs. what you’re getting in a stock deal. If more value is being given away, then don’t do it!

190, What's the role of the board of directors?,"Most writers and shareholders probably have a little bit of a distorted view of how most large corporations have operated over the years. For a long time, most directors were sort of like potted plants. Management had its agenda and didn’t want input on major matters and Charlie and I can testify that we’ve had very little success in influencing big issues. If someone’s spent 20-30 years rising to become CEO, they don’t want a board telling them what to do. It’s changed a little bit today in terms of process.Overwhelmingly, the most important job of the board is to pick the right CEO. If you were on the board of Cap Cities and you hired Tom Murphy, case closed.The second most important job of a board is to prevent the CEO from overreaching. A board should bring independent judgment on acquisitions. There’s a natural tendency for CEOs to want to become bigger by spending other people’s money. The deal is already done by the time the board knows about it. The investment banker comes in and I’ve never seen a banker say, “This is a dumb idea.”When a significant deal comes along, it’s a chance for the board to weigh in and discuss the economics of what’s going on. But the CEO doesn’t bring a deal unless he wants it done and so he stacks the deck. Or half of you wouldn’t be here. It gets swept under the rug.We owned a bank that went to acquire a smaller bank. The CEO of the smaller bank held out for a high price and various terms and conditions and, because he was taking stock, had one last condition for the acquiring bank: “Promise never to do a deal this dumb in the future.” LaughterI’ve been on some terrific boards. The best was probably a local business, Data Documents. Every board member had a significant percentage of his net worth in the company and every decision was made for business reasons.In contrast, the standard now is when deal is possible, trot in the investment bankers. I know the answer: they always say, “This is a great deal.”At Berkshire, almost everyone on the board has a lot of Berkshire stock. They’re in the same position as shareholders. They don’t have D&O Directors and Officers insurance and they bought the stock in the open market. It’s a real owners board.",1

192, Your thoughts on EBITDA?,"It amazes me how widespread the use of EBITDA has become. People try to dress up financial statements with it.We won't buy into companies where someone's talking about EBITDA. If you look at all companies, and split them into companies that use EBITDA as a metric and those that don't, I suspect you'll find a lot more fraud in the former group. Look at companies like Wal-Mart, GE and Microsoft -- they'll never use EBITDA in their annual report.People who use EBITDA are either trying to con you or they're conning themselves. Telecoms, for example, spend every dime that's coming in. Interest and taxes are real costs.""back to the questions.(https://buffettfaq.com/#questions)The equation is simple, but practice doesn’t always follow logic. Assuming you’ve been honest with shareholders in communicating enough information so they can estimate intrinsic value, then if your stock is far below intrinsic value, buying it back adds a lot of value. The Washington Post did this and Teledyne bought back 90% of its stock over time.Today, stock buybacks are popular. The underlying rationale – not the professed rationale – is that people hope the stock price won’t go down. But often this doesn’t make sense for shareholders. If the stock is underpriced, buy it back with excess cash; if it’s overvalued, don’t buy a single share.If we wanted to return cash to shareholders, we’d go to them and say, “Our stock is cheap and we’re going to return cash to you by buying it back.”In terms of dividends, you get into an expectational problem. Most public companies don’t bounce around their dividend from year to year (although this is very common in private companies and Berkshire subsidiaries) because investors come to rely on it. So once you establish a dividend policy at a public company, think a long time before changing it.In a Fortune article I published in 1999 Mr. Buffett on the Stock Market(http://www.fortune.com/fortune/articles/0,15114,374423,00.html), 11/99, the frictional costs are equal to the total amount paid out in dividends.Companies should be paying out dividends. Take See’s Candies: we haven’t figured out a way to grow it, so we can’t reinvest, so something approaching a 100% payout of profits would make sense were it a public company. Most managements want to ensure regularity of dividends, so they go with a conservative level below 100%.We think about this at Berkshire. If we didn’t think we could put it all of our excess cash to work, then we’d pay it out. But we expect – and this is reasonable, I think – that we will have the chance to put it to work.If we decided to return cash to shareholders and if our stock wasn’t underpriced, then we’d probably pay out a dividend – but don’t count on it anytime soon.---------------------------------------------------One reason not to pay a dividend is taxes, but we’ve always said that even if we could have paid a tax-free dividend, we would not have done so. Our test has been whether, if we retain a dollar, will it be worth more than a dollar in present value. So far we’ve always passed this test.But it’s no fun sitting on $40 billion, which earned less than 1% last year after tax. The burden of proof will shift in the next few years. We always ask, “Can we use the money effectively within our business?” So far, the answer has been yes. This will be discussed at our board meeting on Monday.---------------------------------------------------Most of the time, we wouldn’t be able to buy an amount of our stock that would be material to our remaining shareholders. We probably have less opportunity to do so than other large companies.Buffett then put up this chart, which showed share turnover last year for the following companies: Berkshire Hathaway 14%, Exxon Mobil 76%, General Electric 48%, General Motors 487%, Wal-Mart 79%Look at these turnover figures. I think Berkshire has lower turnover by some margin than any major company in the U.S. I put Wal-Mart up there because the Walton family owns more of Wal-Mart than I do of Berkshire, so our low share turnover is not just because of that.Our shareholders are long-term and loyal owners. We have the most honest-to-god attitude of ownership of any public company. People buy it to own it. It does mean that if it gets cheap, we won’t be able to buy much. But that’s OK. We’re not looking to make money off shareholders by buying them out at a discount.The motivation for buying back stock used to be just because companies thought their shares were cheap. Thirty or forty years ago, it was very fertile to invest in companies that were buying back their stock. The most extreme case was Teledyne – we made some money investing there.But that’s being swamped today by companies doing it because it’s in fashion or to prop up the stock. The SEC has rules to prevent propping up the stock on a daily basis but companies still try to do it. We wouldn’t do it for those reasons.A few years ago, when we were willing to buy back our stock, the fact of writing about it in the 1999 annual letter, page 16 eliminated the opportunity.It’s very interesting that Buffett had this slide prepared in advance. I think it’s because he knows his stock is cheap – we think it’s as cheap as it was on March 10, 2000, the only time he’s ever been willing to buy it back – and the company is much stronger and has a much brighter outlook than it did then. Buffett no doubt expected that he might catch some flak from shareholders for not announcing a buyback, but rather than addressing that question directly, he chose to deflect it by basically arguing that even if that would be the best use of Berkshire’s capital right now, the stock is too illiquid to buy back much stock anyway.All of this being said, even if the stock were more liquid, I’m not pounding the table for share repurchases in light of the acquisition of Iscar. I’m drooling at the prospect of more acquisitions like this one – as are, I’m sure, Buffett and Munger.---------------------------------------------------Q - You've previously encouraged companies to repurchase stock. Please could you address the issue of Berkshire buying back its own shares?. My comments go back a lot of years. I haven’t written about other companies repurchasing in about 10 years. Repurchases in recent years were foolish, because they paid too much. They were trying to give out buy recommendations that weren’t justified. In the 1970s and 1980s, we encouraged others to repurchase because shares were demonstrably cheaper than anything else. We only felt in 2000 that we wanted to do so, because Berkshire’s intrinsic value didn’t match its stock price. But it was self-defeating the announcement of Buffett’s intention to repurchase sent Berkshire’s stock higher. Repurchases should be quite compelling, and that doesn’t exist now. Ninety percent of repurchases in the last five years were at silly prices and not in the interest of shareholders. Managers did it because it was what everyone else was doing. It’s interesting how many companies bought at two times current prices that aren’t buying now.",1

194, Why do you not believe in dividends when Benjamin Graham believed in them?,"I had to show a little individuality. laughter I do believe in dividends, including dividends at companies where we own stock. The test on dividends is, ‘can you create more than one dollar of value with the one you retain?’ It would be a mistake for See’s to retain money because they have no ability to use the cash they make to generate a high return internally. We hope to move the capital to a place where it will be worth $1.20. If we do that, taxable or not, they are better off if we retain money. But when the time comes that we don’t think we can use money effectively, we will pay it out. But because we have the ability to redistribute money in a tax-efficient way within the company, we have more reason to retain earnings in the company. We like companies where we have investments to pay to us the money they can’t use effectively. Costco paid no dividend when they were growing rapidly. As St. Augustine said: “God give me chastity, but not yet.”----------------------------------------------------Q - From 2003 through 2008, Berkshire’s market price didn’t increase by the amount of retained earnings, why don't you change Berkshire’s dividend policy?. If we had to sell our business on December 31, 2008, we would have had a loss. Reinvested earnings did not produce gains. We use book value as a proxy for business value. We measure against the S&P 500—our intrinsic value has never had a five-year period when we underperformed the S&P 500. In a terrified market, Wells Fargo got to below $9—when aspects of their business were never better, and their business model is fabulous. Pushed by a student, I said that if I had to put all of my money in one stock, it would be Wells Fargo at $9.00. Wells will be a lot better off a couple of years from now than if all this business had never happened, unless they have to issue lots of shares, which they shouldn’t. You never want to be in a position to have to sell due to a margin call or emotionally. Why would someone sell Wells Fargo at $9.00 when they bought it at $25.00, and now it’s better off? It’s crazy. I own a farm about 30 minutes from here, and if you own a farm, you don’t get a price on it every day. Look at the asset for value, not the price—as you would with a farm. People let the stock price, not business results, affect their assessment of a company. Read Chapter 8 of The Intelligent Investor. The fact that a price quote is available every day turns into a liability.",1

196, Your thoughts on inflation?,"The best thing to combat the threat of inflation is to have a lot of earnings power of your own. If you’re the only surgeon in town, you’ll be OK because you can simply raise your prices to keep up with inflation and people will pay it. Charlie and I think it’s best to own fine businesses that can price in inflationary terms and don’t require big capital investments. See’s Candies can handle an inflationary world and maintain value.Unfortunately, most businesses will not come out well in real terms. Earnings might be up, but the business will be compelled to invest more and more dollars into the business to stay in place. The worst businesses compel you to put more and more in, without any rise in profits.TIPS Treasury Inflation Protected Securities are not a bad investment for people worried about inflation heating up, which we’re seeing signs of.. Charlie, we’re selling a lot of material goods in the other room, so keep quiet. Laughter.---------------------------------------------------The talk of deflation was total nonsense.You would think that the trade deficit, which has resulted in a weaker currency, would have led to higher inflation.The price of oil has risen far more in dollars than in euros.So, inflation matters. It’s always there and is something we think about. But See’s Candies will do fine in an inflationary environment.Yes. For example, we’re paying less for shoes, few of which are made in the U.S. anymore.We don’t want to be long the long bond e.g., he thinks there’s risk of rising interest rates.But if you’d told me two years ago what the macro conditions would be today, I’d have been very surprised by where interest rates are today i.e., he thought they’d be higher.---------------------------------------------------Q - An 11-year-old from New Jersey asked how inflation will affect his generation. How is Buffett preparing for inflation?. Inflation is going to affect you. Long term, even a small amount is bad. It’s certain we’ll have inflation over time. Volcker opined against an FOMC Federal Open Market Committee 2% target for inflation. It is something of a slippery slope. Current policies are bound to have inflationary consequences. Inflation is a classic way to reduce the cost of external debt. Federal revenues are going down. Politicians say that taxpayers pay for this or that, but if taxes are less now, who’s paying? The real payers are those affected by the shrinkage of the value of the dollar down the road. The people who are really paying are those that are buying fixed income investments now—the Chinese, for example. That’s the ultimate price of stimulus. The easiest thing to do inflate is the likeliest. The best protection from inflation is your own earning power. The second best is owning a wonderful business, such as Coke, that doesn’t require capital. With Coke, you’ll get your share of national earnings. You give me credit for more brainpower than I actually bring to the question. You can’t look at any metric. If it gets going, it creates its own dynamic and is very hard to stop. We saw it in 1970s until Volcker came in with a sledge hammer. Prime rate was at 21% and governments up to 15%. We had a demonstration project 30 yrs ago. If we continue today’s policies, something like that could be possible. Trend is not destiny. We have power to control our future. We do it through elected representatives If inflation gets into saddle, faith in institutions could break down.Currencies are a poorer bet than they have been in a long time but I do not know what that means for the near future. Remember that your money can be inflated away but your talent cannot. As long as you are the best at what you do you will be entitled to your portion of profits. Contribute the most to civilization and counter the effects of inflation. To outsmart others isn’t the best way to do it. If you are best painter or best brain surgeon, you will always command your share of the economy around you. Talent is terrific asset to deal with it. The best defense is to contribute to the world and to try to make yourself more talented.",1

199, What's your opinion of Enron and creative accounting?,"To the extent people will look more carefully at companies, Enron was a plus to the American economy.Enron will have a distinct beneficial effect on auditors, and it was much needed.. ""It will have a distinct beneficial effect on one less auditor.I think it would have been a shame if Salomon had gone under. Charlie and I may disagree on this one. What about the innocent bottom 40,000 people at Arthur Andersen?What if we did something terrible? Would it be fair for all of Berkshire's employees to suffer?--------------------------------------------------Gen Re was discounting Workman's Comp reserves at 4.5% -- figures we inherited. These were not conservative, so we're now using 1% in 2003 and going forward. Thus, our figures reported profits in Q1 would be even better if we hadn't made this change.I felt much more comfort working with financial statements in the 1960s than today. There was more information then, even through there was less disclosure.In the case of Gen Re, having overly aggressive Workman's Comp reserves was a quick fix, but it's like heroin. Like trade loading, people seek a quick fix. People are encouraged by their CFO or auditors to play with their numbers. It never works, though I guess if you're 64 and a half years old and about to cash in your stock and retire, maybe it does. It's so much better to address problems.In a news conference on Sunday, Buffett was quoted as saying: ""You would be amazed how compliant auditors have been in the past decade, not only co-operating but suggesting techniques for making numbers less useful -- less truthful -- to investors.""The real problem is accounting for pension and healthcare liabilities. I've looked at companies recording pension income of hundreds of millions of dollars when their pension plan is underfunded by billions of dollars. It's the same mentality as stock options.--------------------------------------------------Any accounting that gives people a rationale to reduce reserves even further is bad. There’s such a tendency to reduce reserves for long-tailed insurance policies – to understate them – especially if the CEO is retiring or options are vesting.In derivatives, both sides book a profit; this is especially true of traders who are on commission.We’re three years into unwinding Gen Re’s derivatives book and you would not believe the complexity. Most of it was marked to market, so you’d think it would only take a few days to unwind.I don’t think any regulator or auditor has any hope of getting a handle on any big derivatives book.",1

201, What's your opinion of day trading?,"If you take the percentage of bonds and stocks held by people who could change their minds tomorrow based on what the Fed does, etc., it’s gone up a lot.

There’s nothing evil about it, but it’s a different game and there are consequences. If you’re trying to beat the other fellow on a day-to-day basis and you’re watching the news or the other fellow, and you think he’s going to push the sell button, you’ll try to push it quicker.When Charlie and I were at Salomon, they talked about 5- or 6-sigma events, but that doesn’t mean anything when you’re talking about real markets and human behavior. Look at what happened in 1998 and in 2002. You’ll see it when people try to beat the markets day by day.When I set up my partnership the Buffett Partnership, I told my partners they’d hear from me once a year.

203, What's your opinion on asbestos liability?,"Asbestos is a big part of our liabilities. But we are capped, which is a good thing because asbestos continues to explode. Last year, we said it would be worse than anyone expected and it has been and will continue to be. Many companies thought to be insulated are being dragged in.Asbestos is actually creating some opportunities for Berkshire to buy companies that went bankrupt due to asbestos claims -- free of asbestos liabilities. We probably wouldn't own Johns Manville were it not for asbestos.It's a cancer on the American corporate world and it's growing.. ""Asbestos has morphed into a situation with enormous amounts of fraud, etc. People with serious injuries are being hurt as more and more money flows to the plaintiff's bar and claimants with no current injuries. The Supreme Court has practically invited Congress to step in, but Congress has refused due to the influence of the trial lawyers. I'd be surprised if there's a constructive solution in the next five years. I expect there will just be more of the current mess.There was a solution, but the Supreme Court didn't allow it.We've very careful to avoid asbestos liabilities. I'm not worried about our insurance companies via-a-vis their exposure to asbestos.You have a plaintiff's bar -- going beyond asbestos -- that will take any human adversity and try to make a profit out of it by suing those with deep pockets.---------------------------------------------------We own Johns Manville and their behavior was reprehensible.We have no connection to this. The Manville Trust has billions of dollars and has been around for close to 20 years.It didn’t have a record number of claims last year due to new injuries. Rather, it’s a honey pot. But they’re only paying 5% on claims, so the guy who’s been drastically injured is only getting a small amount. It’s not the right way to do it.Regarding the proposed legislation in Congress: in the end, we didn’t support it. It wasn’t the answer we needed.The Supreme Court, when they ducked it, they left a problem that will be around for decades and decades.---------------------------------------------------",1

205, What are your thoughts on short selling?,"It's an interesting item to study. It's ruined a lot of people. You can go broke doing it.You'll see way more stocks that are dramatically overvalued than dramatically undervalued. It's common for promoters to cause a stock to become valued at 5-10 times its true value, but rare to find a stock trading at 10-20% of its true value. So you might think short selling is easy, but it's not. Often stocks are overvalued because there is a promoter or a crook behind it. They can often bootstrap into value by using the shares of their overvalued stock. For example, it it's worth $10 and is trading at $100, they might be able to build value to $50. Then, Wall Street says, ""Hey! Look at all that value creation!"" and the game goes on. As a short seller, you could run out of money before the promoter runs out of ideas.""Everything we've ever thought about shorting worked out eventually, but it's very painful. It's a whole lot easier to make money on the long side. You can't make big money shorting because the risk of big losses means you can't make big bets.We would never short anyway because we're too big.-------------------------------------------------------""Charlie and I have agreed on around 100 stocks over the years that we thought were shorts or promotions. Had we acted on them, we might have lost all of our money, every though we were right just about every time. A bubble plays on human nature. Nobody knows when it's going to pop, or how high it will go before it pops.A.W. Jones, which had a long-short model, developed the best-known hedge fund in the late 1950s and early 1960s. They were market neutral, but didn't stick with it. Something went wrong with A.W. Jones. A very high percentage of its spin-off funds bit the dust. There were suicides and people lost their fortunes and had to drive cabs.Ben Graham didn't find shorting particularly successful. Quite a high percentage of his paired investments worked, but he lost a lot on the few he lost on.I had a harrowing experience shorting a stock in 1954. I wouldn't have been wrong over 10 years, but I was very wrong after 10 weeks, which was the relevant period. My net worth was evaporating.Shorting is just tough. You must bet small. You can't short the whole company. It takes just one to kill you. As it rises, it consumes more and more money.-------------------------------------------------------There’s nothing evil about short selling. There are people on the short side who have done things to make some stocks go down – some of which is appropriate and some of which is inappropriate. People do that on the long side as well, so I have no ax to grind with short sellers. We have no problem with anyone shorting Berkshire stock. There’s nothing I’d like more than to be paid to lend my stock to shorts.I do think it’s a very tough way to make a living, both financially and psychologically. If you buy something at $20, you can lose $20. If you short at $20, you’re loss can be infinite.As you know, we have a friend who’s been outspoken on naked shorting referring to Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, who used to be President and CEO of Berkshire subsidiary Fechheimer Brothers. I don’t have a great problem with it. If anyone wants to do that with Berkshire, more power to ‘em.Companies with a large short interest very often have been revealed as frauds or semi- frauds – not the one my friend runs. Over the years, I’ve probably had 100 ideas of things to short and I would have eventually been right on almost all of them. But because it’s so hard to get the timing right, I likely wouldn’t have made much money and there would have been a huge opportunity cost. Someone who’s running a fraud is probably very good at it and can keep it going a long time. I would never put money with a short fund – not because I have any problem with it ethically, but because I question if they could make money over time.--------------------------------------------I’ve never been in a position to ask a broker from whom I’ve bought to deliver the shares and not had it happen.I don’t see the problem of people shorting stocks, assuming they’re not manipulating the market. I would welcome people wanting to short Berkshire. In fact, I’d lend them stock and earn extra income. They’re a certain future buyer.If anyone wants to naked short Berkshire, they can do it until the cows come home. In fact, we’ll hold a special meeting for them. LaughterThe shorts generally have a tougher time of it in this world. More people are bullish on stocks. It’s a tough way to make a living. It’s very easy to spot a phony stock or a heavily promoted stock, but it’s hard to say when it will turn. If it’s trading at five times its intrinsic value, there’s no reason it can’t trade at ten times.I don’t see shorts as any great threat to the world. If a lot of people want to short your stock, they have to pay you for the borrow. We did this with USG. One large brokerage firm approached us about lending out our stock and we were happy to do this. We charged them a lot. We even forced them to hold it for a certain period of time so we could continue to earn money on the borrow. There is nothing wrong with people who are positive or negative speaking out as long as they are responsible for what they say. You can do things on the long or short side that are unethical or illegal. Anytime you attack conventional wisdom though, you will get a lot of negative feedback. When he and Charlie criticized the EMH (Efficient Market Hypothesis), it was so widely accepted people didn’t like their comments. In general he has no problem with short selling. For the most part we are criticizing the wrong people (the short sellers). The people the criticisms should go to are the accountants who allowed the bad accounting should be held in the dock. The accountants let this happen, and they get very little criticism, and that is a mistake.",1

208, Are corporate jets a waste of shareholders’ money?,"I want to report that we’re solidly in favor of private jets. LaughterCharlie used to travel by bus, and only when they had a senior discount. In recent years, I’ve shamed him into getting a NetJets share; I have two. Berkshire is better off because we use corporate jets. I don’t know which deals wouldn’t have been made, but I do know that without a private jet I would not have had the enthusiasm to travel thousands of miles to see deal after deal. It’s a valuable business tool.It can be misused like everything else. I remember that one time we invested in a company and the CEO stopped in Omaha to see me. He used a grocery chain in Idaho to test products, but also had a lodge there. Properly used, corporate jets have been a real asset to Berkshire. If the trappings of power are greatly abused, I think you would find those companies would be disappointing to investors. The Roman emperor who was best remembered was Marcus Aurelius – he had no trappings of power, though he could have. The best way to combat the excesses of leaders is to have examples of exemplary behavior.",1

210, Can you forecast the continuing debate between Efficient Market Theory (EMT) proponents and value investors? Are your designated successors “outliers” as well?,"The market is generally fairly efficient in evaluating asset classes, but not always efficient in valuing specific businesses. I think EMT probably hit its peak in popularity twenty years ago; it became terribly popular in academia. You had to buy into it to get anywhere in academia. People would have had to give up the work on their Ph.D. theses if they rejected the EMT.It doesn't appear to be as popular these days. I don’t know if it’s as much holy writ as it once was. Some schools are now offering other courses that really help you learn to value a company. But it’s hard to dislodge a belief that becomes dogma in finance departments.There’s something about the whole thing that’s always puzzled me. If companies are always valued perfectly because everyone else knows more than you do about everything, then there’s nothing else for you to do. I’ve always wondered what they talk about on the second day of class in that course. The first day they tell you that the markets are efficient and value everything just fine.

213, Thoughts on banks willingness to deal with shady characters?,"It’s amazing what goes on. Salomon was at least as disciplined and rational as other investment banks, but by the end Salomon was begging for investment business from Robert Maxwell(http://www.abacon.com/folkerts/profile5.html), whose nickname was “The Bouncing Czech.” You’d think if this was his nickname, investment banks wouldn’t be chasing his business.The day they found him bobbing in the water; he committed suicide as the scandal about his misdeeds broke, we Salomon sent money to him in exchange for money he was sending to us, but he didn’t pay. So, we went to England to collect from his sons and it was a mess. We got what we deserved.To an investment banker, his earnings would be affected to a significant way if he wrote a few more tickets to Maxwell. You have to control this if guys can make money by bringing dubious things in the door.Buffett and Munger chuckled to themselves as they recalled Salomon doing business with another shady character they didn’t name. At the 2002 annual meeting, however, Munger identified the company as First Normandy, an IPO that Salomon had to pull before money exchanged hands when they discovered the promoter had completely manufactured his record. In fact, the company was called Normandy America Inc. and, according to a report(https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr15075.txt) on the SEC’s web site, “Normandy's stock commenced trading on the NASDAQ National Market System on August 15, 1995. One day later, Normandy withdrew its offering from the market and rescinded all trades.”.CM dripping with sarcasm: That was a wonderful experience. Warren, Lou Simpson and I were all on the board of Salomon, we were the largest shareholders, and we said, “Don’t do business with this guy.” But they ignored us and said that the underwriting committee had approved it.He had a neon sign on him saying “CROOK.” He did go to jail. Incidentally, he claimed to have owned a lot of Berkshire stock and to have made a lot of money on it, but I checked the shareholder records and couldn’t see it. It could have been in street name, but for a block that big, I think I would have found it so he was probably lying about his Berkshire holdings.",1

215, Risk of holding assets at banks or brokerage houses?,"As a depositor in major banks and brokerages firms, I wouldn’t worry. We have a too-big-to-fail view toward large institutions to protect depositors – though this is not true of equity holders or margin accounts.back to the questions.(https://buffettfaq.com/#questions)Some of the tax shelter proposals that were sponsored by the most prominent auditing firms were absolutely disgusting. Such schemes are one of the reasons why the middle class pays more taxes than it should.Berkshire is a heavy contributor to the Treasury. As I pointed out in the annual report, if only 540 contributors paid what we did last year, no-one else would have pay anything – corporate, personal, social security, etc. taxes.Sure, we buy tax-exempt bonds sometimes but we pay full 34% taxes on our capital gains.And the lawyers wrote the opinions blessing these schemes – don’t leave them out.We had people come to our office, from top auditing firms – but not our auditors Deloitte & Touche – and they wanted us to sign confidentiality agreements for schemes to set up 20 offshore trusts, etc. It was designed to be so complex and spread out that no IRS agent could figure out the totality.It makes everyone else pay more. I was a little hard on Pamela Olsen Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy at the U.S. Treasury, who Buffett criticized in his annual letter(http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2003.html) (pages 6-7) for accusing him of “playing the tax code like a fiddle”, but I applaud Pamela on her work exposing this.",1

220, Are investment banks so complex that the head is not aware of the risks?,"Exceptionally good question. The answer is probably yes in most places, though there are a few CEOs I respect a lot. Gen Re had 23,000 derivative contracts. I could have worked full time on that, and I probably still couldn’t have gotten my head around it all. And we had exposures that I thought were possible and heads of business units didn’t — I don’t want slim, I want none. I am Chief Risk Officer at Berkshire. If something goes wrong, I cannot assign it to a committee. I think big investment banks and big commercial banks are almost too big to manage effectively in the way they have elected to run their business. It will work most of the time. You may not see the risk. A 1-in-50-year risk - it won’t be in the interest of a 62 year old executive who is retiring at 65 to worry about it. I worry about everything. Many CEOs say they didn’t know about what was going on. It’s easier to admit he doesn’t know what’s going on than to admit that he knew what was going on and let it go on. I’ve been asked for advice on regulation. Somehow, the press hasn’t picked up on this too much. OFHEO Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight supervised Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac—their activities had a public element, and were semi-regulated. For 200 people at OFHEO it was their sole job to examine the books. They were two-for-two with two of the biggest accounting scams in the history of the world. The person at the top must have it in their DNA to see risks. In many ways, there are firms that in terms of risk are too big to manage. If too big to fail, there are interesting policy implications. Salomon Salomon Brothers during the 1991 scandal was trading with Marc Rich who had fled the country. They said they wanted to keep trading with him. Only by total directive could we stop it. I think the Fed did the right thing with Bear Stearns. They would have failed on Sunday night, and walked to a bankruptcy judge. They had $14.5 trillion of derivative contracts — not as bad as it sounds, but the parties that had those contracts would have been required to undo the contracts to establish the liability from the estate. With the $400 million at Gen Re, we had 4-5 years. At Bear, it would have been 4-5 hours. It would have been a spectacle. Two of the witnesses at the testimony said, ‘we understood we couldn’t borrow unsecured, but we didn’t understand we couldn’t borrow secured.’ The world does not have to lend you money. If they don’t want to lend you money, an extra 10 basis points won’t make a difference. It depends on people’s willingness to lend you money, which comes down to how other people feel about you. If you are dependent on borrowed money, you have to wake up every day worried about what the world thinks of you.",1

222, What are the risks in the financial system? (2005),"I think our currency will weaken, but I’m not the Armageddon type. I think most of our citizens will be better off in 10 or 20 years.I’m concerned about our political leadership, but as Peter Lynch once said, “Invest in businesses any idiot could run because someday one will.” (Laughter) We’ve had all sorts of bad Presidents, but have still done well. Our real GDP per capital rose seven-fold in the last century, which is remarkable.Sure, the big consumer debt load and trade deficit could cause some financial market distress – there are great investment opportunities in dislocations – but the country will survive.Eventually the country will do fine, but there’s a significant possibility of a chaotic situation.Far greater sums in one asset class after another are on a hair trigger. We’re piling up huge financial assets at intermediaries, which lend themselves to huge dislocations. We’ve turned over huge amounts of money to people who want to beat the S&P in the short term, and while they may appear to be independent, their actions are not independent. They can all try to head to the exits at the same time. But if you’re selling, you must find a buyer. The only way to sell a burning seat in the theater is to find someone else to buy it.Is there anyone we’ve forgotten to offend? We don’t want to miss anyone. (Laughter)Q - Risks in the Global Financial System?Charlie and I are not as on board on this, so I’ll answer it and then Charlie can share his thoughts.We have a $618 billion trade deficit and an even larger current account deficit. As large as we are, something will change for the worse and the longer it goes on, the worse it will be. Most economists say a soft landing is likely, but they don’t say what this will look like. How the numbers come down is quite significant. Paul Volcker has expressed apprehension about the likelihood of a soft landing.There’s as high a percentage as there’s ever been of money on a hair trigger – in foreign exchange, stocks, bonds, the carry trade.When people go to bed at night – an electronic herd – that can sell billions of dollars at the press of a key. I think this is at an all-time high. An exogenous event, like Long Term Capital Management – and it will happen – could trigger a stampede.If you hold dollars, you can’t get rid of them. You can’t sell them to the U.S., because you’d get dollar-denominated assets in return. And you can’t sell them to another country, like France I forget the reason he gave.He read a quote from Paul Volcker’s recent article in the Washington Post and concluded: The situation is dangerous and intractable and is at an all-time high. But I can’t predict the timing.I would say that what’s going on with the trade deficit will have serious consequences. But in the last Presidential race, neither candidate addressed it, which is understandable. 90% of the American people can’t define “current account” and it’s hard to describe in three minutes. And it’s not the kind of issue that Betty the average American voter, when she’s making her toast in the morning, asks herself, “Gee, that trade deficit is really unsettling me today.”Charlie has a different view. Charlie?How do you think it will end? We’re like an incredibly rich family. We sit on the porch of our huge farm – so big that we can’t even see the end of it – and each year, we consume 6% more than the farm produces. To pay for this, each year we sell or mortgage a little bit of the farm that we can’t see, so we don’t even notice. We’re very, very rich and the rest of the world is happy to buy from us or lend to us, so each year they take a piece of our valuable assets – and they work very hard.But we will have to service this. If it goes on for a long time, our children will pay. We’re sending $2 billion per day overseas right now.What will cause a crisis? I don’t know. Does it reach a tipping point, or will there be an exogenous event?I have a hard time conceiving of any scenario in which the dollar appreciates.Imagine that if, instead of fighting the Revolutionary War, we’d instead agreed to give Britain 3% of our GDP each year. This might have looked good in 1776, but not to future generations. It’s like taxation without representation.",1
223, What can we learn from past blow-ups?,"They’re all a little different, and they all have similarities. This one had origins in the mortgage field and residential real estate. Trouble in one area has a way of spreading to another area. In my lifetime, I can’t remember one where this particular residential real estate bubble sent out the kind of shock wave and exposure of so many other bad practices and weaknesses elsewhere like this one. There isn’t any magic to analysis. There are stupid things that won’t be done soon again; and not the same way again. But variations of it will occur again. Humans are what lead to stupidity and behavior. Primal urges, wanting to believe in the tooth fairy that pops up from time to time, sometimes occur on a very big scale. I have no great insights on the solutions. It was a particularly foolish mess. We talked about an idiot in the credit delivery grocery business, Webvan. An Internet-based delivery service for groceries that failed terribly—that was smarter than what happened in the mortgage business. I wish we had those Webvan people back. I have a rule: The politicians are never so bad you don’t live to want them back. laughter",1
224, Do you think the bankruptcy process should be reformed?,"I think much of how bankruptcy is handled is pretty horrible. It’s a situation where courts themselves have gone into the business of bidding to attract bankruptcy proceedings. They’ve found that if they develop a process in which they over-pay people (lawyers, etc.), they can attract the most cases. It’s so upsetting to watch that I don’t follow it as much as I should. I’m an old man and I don’t like to have an upset stomach. Laughter. We bought a lot of the Enron bonds called Ospreys. The Ospreys were a complex situation and we considerably more than tripled our money. In other situations, we got outbid, like with Burlington and Sitel. We owed all of the Sitel bonds, though, so we came out fine.Anytime there’s something big and complicated, there might be some mispricing. But recently, the mispricing has been on the high side. Many people are looking in this area, so it’s a field that does not have a lot of potential right now, but it will again.Over the next 10-15 years, we’re likely to do something big in the bankruptcy area. I remember the Eastern Airlines bankruptcy. The courts abused the senior bondholders to protect the employees and communities. Based on the law, you’d have come to one conclusion and the courts did the opposite.There are a very interesting set of dynamics involved in these types of cases.

227, Insurance pricing and risk?,"In auto insurance, our policies are up more than premium volume, so the average premium is down a little bit. In reinsurance, in which we are a big player, there are great variances. For marine risks on the Gulf Coast (rigs, etc.), prices are up dramatically, as they should be. Premiums paid for this type of risk were $2.5 billion and the payouts were $15 billion so obviously the pricing wasn’t sufficient.In the past few years, we’ve been the largest writer of mega-cat insurance in the world, and I’m sure we will be this year. Prices are up a lot, but we don’t know if exposures are up even more. We don’t know if the experience of the last two years the worst hurricanes in U.S. history is to be relied upon more than the past 100 years. They tell you two different things. We do know that it would be silly to assume that the past two years are outliers. Atmospheric conditions and water temperatures have changed. This could change the propensity of hurricanes to occur and their severity. If the last two years are relevant e.g., become the norm, then we’re not getting paid enough for the reinsurance we’re writing currently.The scary possibility is that the changes are continuous and that the changes in the past two years build up. It gets into chaos theory, whereby the output is not a linear relationship. You could dream up some very scary scenarios.We are willing to write in certain areas and with certain coverages because we can sustain the losses. We’re willing to sustain big losses because we have the financial strength and think we’re getting paid enough. But it’s not like flipping a coin or rolling dice – there are many changing variables.In the third quarter, we will have a lot of exposure to wind damage claims – but not as much as a couple of years ago. Prices are hardening in that particular area. If the prices go back to what they were last year, we will write a lot less.We don’t believe in modeling. The modelers don’t know a thing. It’s silly. We get paid for making guesses on it. Over a lifetime, we’ll know if we were right. Even if there are low losses this year, we won’t know if we’re right.It’s still a business we like. If there’s a super-super catastrophe, say $250 billion (four times Katrina), we would pay maybe $10 billion. We could pay, and comfortably pay, but many others in the industry would be in trouble.Over 5-10 years, we’ll know how well we did.. The record of the past, if you average it out, has been quite respectable. Why shouldn’t we use our capital strength to get into volatile areas that make others uncomfortable?We’re getting close to 10% of the float of the American property and casualty insurance industry, so we can’t continue to grow as fast as we have, but it will be attractive. I’m aware of the risks like pandemics – you’re aware of them too – and we get offers every day.We think about $20 billion or $50 billion events and up. It’s a question of making judgments of whether we’re getting paid enough. We’ll know in 30 years. If we have a lot of money then, we’ll know we were right. If we take a big loss this year, it doesn’t mean we are wrong. What will hurricane losses be in 10 years? I don’t know, but I’ll keep thinking about it every day.You have this possibility that a 1-2% change can lead to 100%+ increases in losses. That’s the game we’re playing, but if we don’t like the prices we’re being offered – and we haven’t in many areas – we don’t play and we’re happy to have someone take our place in line.",1

229, How do you manage insurance risk?,"We are doing some things in insurance that have some correlations. For example, we have insured a lot of things in California and if you have the right earthquake at the right time, not only could National Indemnity and GEICO incur losses, but See’s and Wells Fargo would as well. And we used to own Freddie Mac which would get hit as well.I think about this a lot – it’s my job to think about the absolute worst-case scenario. No matter what happens, we’ll be OK.The most likely mega-cat is a hurricane. In Long Island, there’s huge exposure by the entire insurance industry. The last big hurricane hit there in the 1930s and insurance is being priced accordingly. But everything that can happen will happen.The most powerful earthquake in U.S. history – 9.0 – was in New Madrid, Missouri.It’s Berkshire’s job to be absolutely prepared for the very worst. A few years ago, we didn’t have nuclear/chemical/biological risk exclusions in our insurance policies – we had huge risk, but it’s gone now.We wrote a policy for $500 million in excess of $2.5 billion, not caused by a nuclear/chemical/biological attack, on a major international airport. There was a cap of $1.6 billion for business interruption, so there would have to be more than $900 million of property damage before we’d have to pay anything.We insured the NCAA basketball Final Four against being cancelled (not moved or postponed), excluding nuclear/chemical/biological attacks. We would have paid $75 million in this event. We also insured the Grammy’s in a similar way. We’re OK with losing a lot of money, as long as we’re being paid appropriately for the risk.Nuclear/chemical/biological attacks are excluded from virtually all of our policies. We write it only when we’re specifically getting paid for it.No-one has attacked it more vigorously than we have. It’s Armageddon here every day. (Laughter)My aunt, who died last year, had everything she had in Berkshire stock. With investors like this, it would be crazy to take any risks to jeopardize this company to make an extra $100,000 or add a point to the track record. Maybe if I had a 2/20 incentive fee structure; 2% management fee and 20% promote, I’d behave differently, but I sure hope not.back to the questions.(https://buffettfaq.com/#questions)Consolidation is a funny thing. I don’t think it solves many problems: putting two lousy businesses together usually makes one big lousy business.

USAA is the same way; in fact their ways of operating are a lot like GEICO’s - but they only offer their products to a narrow clientele, whereas GEICO offers theirs to a much wider group. In general, we’re well-positioned in the industry; we have the best insurance vehicle in the business.",1

If we calculated the resulting price to be $1 million, then we’d price it at $1.2 million to build in a margin of safety.It’s difficult if someone wants to protect against a 9.0 quake, which happens only once every 1,000 years.

In automobile insurance, we have fraud units.We have lost more money in Workman’s Comp insurance than just about any other line in terms of aggregate dollars. It’s been a tough period. We have one small direct seller of Workman’s Comp insurance in California, and then Gen Re does Workman’s Comp reinsurance, and it’s been a bloodbath – the rates haven’t covered the losses. There’s been a fair amount of fraud, especially in the direct lines.Many companies that have been in the Workman’s Comp business, especially in California, wish they hadn’t. They haven’t made money from it.But the main fraud isn’t by insurance carriers against small businessmen, but by the doctors, lawyers, etc. doing it against the carriers.",1

A lot of ridiculous credit is being extended in the U.S. housing sector. There was a horrible aftermath in manufactured housing and my guess is that we’re likely to see something similar as a result of the unwise credit being extended in the overall housing sector. Look at the latest 10-Qs of financial institutions and the levels of accrued, but not paid, interest. You’ll see some interesting things. It’s growing rapidly, which means the lenders are booking earnings, but not receiving the cash e.g., borrowers are falling behind in their payments.Dumb lending always has its consequences. You can have an epidemic and not realize it until you’re very far into it. You had it in commercial real estate in the 1980s and the RTC Resolution Trust Corporation was the result. A developer will build anything he can get financing for. Some of the dumb lending is facilitated by contemptible accounting. The accounting profession has continued to disgrace itself here. We developed a piece of property for 20 years in California. I think we got our money out, plus interest e.g., a terrible rate of return, given the time and effort. It’s not an exaggeration. The land value was $5-6 million when we sold. We finished at the wrong time. What do you think it would be worth now, Charlie?. $100 million.  And REIT accounting is phony.

233, Opinion on the likely housing bubble? (2005),"Americans feel very good about home ownership – for many people, it’s been their best-behaving investment. If it’s a bubble and if it’s pricked, it could affect some Berkshire businesses, but it would also let us put a lot of money to work referring to a likely crisis that would depress stock prices and let them invest some of the $40+ billion cash hoard.We’ve not made our money betting on macro stuff like foreign exchange; instead, it’s from buying cheap stocks like PetroChina.25 years ago, we saw the same thing a real estate bubble with Nebraska farmland. People fled cash, saying “cash is trash.” A farm 30 miles north of here sold for $2,000/acre in 1980; I bought it later for $600/acre. People went crazy and the consequences were huge. Many banks failed, even ones that had survived the Great Depression.I don’t know where we are with housing – people may behave differently because they live in it. But when you get prices increasing at a far greater rate than construction costs or inflation there can be problems.I sold a house in Laguna Beach, CA for $3.5 million. The house was only worth about $500,000, so the land was being valued at $3 million. It was only a fraction of an acre, so the land was being valued at $60 million per acre. That’s a pretty fancy price for almost any land.The financing terms have become easier and easier as prices have risen, which is contrary to normal and prudent practices. But the financing process has become so disintermediated that the mortgage buyer doesn’t care. The easier financing has led to a boom in prices.The Nebraska farm bubble was fueled by banks that historically had been conservative but went crazy. They said that a farm was an asset-appreciation investment, not an income investment – in other words, they were playing the greater fool game.The rest of the world is saving. They’re investing $2 billion/day in the U.S. Some say they have so much confidence in the U.S. that they want to invest, but this is silly. They invest because they have to.Consider the following fanciful illustration. Let’s say we had a fixed population in Omaha and no new houses were built, but each year everyone sold their house to their neighbor and moved. In year one, the price was $100,000. In year two, the price jumped to $150,000, but Fannie and Freddie guaranteed the mortgage and sold it to Asian investors. This is an influx of $50,000 to the family income. In year three, the price jumps to $200,000 and the same thing happens.Obviously, it is transparent what’s happening here, so it wouldn’t really happen, but you can have accidental behavior that leads to certain aspects of this.* * *I have less than 1% of my net worth outside Berkshire and when the Nasdaq hit its high, I had nearly all of it in REITs, which were selling at a discount to their liquidation values. REITs are quite attractive now, especially compared with 5-6 years ago when they were very unpopular.It’s better to pay attention to something being scorned than championed. The swing in property values has been huge in some markets. What we see in our residential brokerage business HomeServices of America, the nation’s second- largest realtor is a slowdown everywhere, most dramatically in the formerly hottest markets. The high end and where properties were bought for investment and speculation are doing the worst.If you buy a house for $300,000 and take a $270,000 mortgage, you’re going to stay there and continue to make your mortgage payments, even if the market value of the house falls (unless something bad happens to you like losing your job). But if you have investors and speculators holding the properties – effectively day traders in the condo market – that kind a speculation can produce a market that can move in a big way. First the buying and selling stops and then the market reopens. With stocks, they will trade every day, so you can’t kid yourself. If you own GM stock and it’s down on Monday, you know you’ve taken a loss. But in housing, there’s always the hope that you can find the one seller who will pay the price you want, who hasn’t heard that the market has collapsed.In Miami-Dade and Broward counties in Florida, the average condo costs $500,000. I may have the numbers slightly off here: Not long ago, there were 3,000 condos listed and 2,900 sold every month. Today, there are 30,000 condos listed – worth $15 billion – and only 2,000 per month are selling. The whole supply-demand equation has changed.We’ve had a real bubble to some degree. I would be surprised if there aren’t some significant downward adjustments, especially in the higher end of the housing market. There’s a bubble among high-end apartments in Manhattan, but in Omaha, housing prices are reasonable.",1
234, How do you feel about the current real estate environment?,"If you are buying to own a home, that is fine. Otherwise, it seems to be getting into bubble territory. We're not excited about real estate because generally there is not enough return at current prices.",1
235, Your views on the securitization of real estate?,"There has been enormous securitization of the debt too of real estate and that is one of the items right now that is really clogging up the capital markets. The mortgage back securities are just not moving, commercial, not residential mortgage backs. But I think you are directing your question at equities probably. The equities, if you leave out the corporate form, have been a lousy way to own equities. You have interjected a corporate income tax into something that people individually have been able to own with a single tax, and to have the normal corporate form you have a double taxation in there. You really don't need it and it takes too much of the return.REITS have, in effect, created a conduit so you don't get the double taxation, but they also generally have fairly high operating expenses. If you get real estate, let's just say you can buy fairly simple types of real estate at an 8% yield, or thereabouts, and you take away close to 1% to 1.5% by the time you count stock options and everything, it is not a terribly attractive way to own real estate. Maybe the only way a guy with a $1,000 or $5,000 can own it but if you have $1 million or $10 million, you are better off owning the real estate properties yourself instead of sticking some intermediary in between who will get a sizable piece of the return for himself. So we have found very little in that field.You will see an announcement in the next couple of weeks that may belie what I am telling you today. I don't want you to think I am double crossing you up here. But generally speaking we have seen very little in that field that gets us excited. People sometimes get very confused about--they will look at some huge land company, like Texas Pacific Land Trust, which has been around over 100 years and has got a couple of million acres in Texas. And they will sell 1% of their land every year and they will take that (as income? Garbled) and come up with some huge value compared to the market value. But that is nonsense if you really own the property. You can't move. You can't move 50% of the properties or 20% of the properties, it is way worse than an illiquid stock. So you get these, I think, you get some very silly valuations placed on a lot of real estate companies by people who really don't understand what it is like to own one and try to move large quantity of properties.REITS have behaved horribly in this market as you know and it is not at all inconceivable that they become a class that would get so unpopular that they would sell at significant discounts from what you could sell the properties for. And they could get interesting as a class and then the question is whether management would fight you in that process because they would be giving up their income stream for managing things and their interests might run counter to the shareholders on that. I have always wondered about REITS that have managements they say their assets are so wonderful, and they are so cheap and then they (management) go out and sell stock. There is a contradiction in that. They say our stock is very cheap at $28 and then they sell a lot of stock at $28 less an underwriting commission. There is a disconnect there. But it is a field we look at.Charlie and I can understand real estate, and we would be open for very big transactions periodically. If there was a LTCM situation translated to real estate, we would be open to that, the trouble is so many other people would be too that it would unlikely go at a price that would get us really get us excited.",1
236, Where do you see the residential real estate market going in the next year or two?,"In places like Omaha, I would buy a house tomorrow, if I were a young person. There are approximately 80 million houses in the country, and about 25 million do not have a mortgage. The situation is being corrected.back to the questions.(https://buffettfaq.com/#questions)The subprime market, encouraged by lenders, intermediaries, builders, etc., led to a lot of people buying houses they couldn’t afford. There will be consequences for these people, but the question is whether it spreads. If unemployment and interest rates don’t go up, then it’s unlikely this factor alone triggers anything in the general economy.In the 10Qs and 10Ks I’ve read, a high percentage of loans allowed people to make tiny payments early on, made up by higher payments later. I think this is dumb lending and dumb borrowing because someone who can only make 20-30% payments now isn’t going to be able to make 110% payments in the future. Those people and institutions were betting that house prices would keep going up. When this stops, you have a big supply of houses come on the market, like we saw in manufactured housing. You’ll see plenty of misery in that field – you’ve already seen some. But I don’t think it’ll be any huge anchor for the economy.

237, Where do you see the residential real estate market going in the next year or two?,"We don’t know. I see a lot of data. In the last few months, you’ve seen a real pick up in activity in California in the low to medium-priced homes at or below $750,000. There are many different markets, and many California markets will be difficult. There’s been no bounce in prices yet, though activity is up on lower prices. Looking at real estate brokerage data, it looks like something close to stability in California in the $750,000 and less segment at these much reduced prices. Mortgages being put on books today are much better than before. Interest rates are down and it’s easier to make payments. It’s improving. There are about 1.3 million households created in a year, but in a recession it tends to be lower. If you create 2.0 million houses a year, then you run into trouble. There’s an excess inventory of about 1.5 million now. With housing starts down to 500,000 annual rate, the excess supply will be absorbed. We are eating up the excess at a rate of 700,000 – 800,000 units per year. It takes a couple of years. There are two options: blow them the excess inventory up—I hope they blow up yours Charlie’s instead of mine—or sell them. South Florida will be tough for a long time. You can’t do it in a day or a week, but it will get done. Then prices will stabilize. Then we can go to building one million per year. The situation is being corrected. You’ve seen some very interesting figures in the past few months on people who didn’t even make the first or second payment. That shouldn’t happen. We saw this is in the manufactured-home sector. When someone only has to make a $3,000 down payment to someone who gets a $6,000 payment the salesperson’s commission, then believe me, you’ll see a lot of bad behavior.Securitization accentuated the problem. A local banker wouldn’t allow this because he’d see what’s going on, but when the loans are bundled and sold by Wall Street, that discipline disappears.It will be at least a couple of years before real estate recovers. In some areas of the country, the housing inventory overhang is huge. The people who were counting on flipping the homes are going to get flipped, but in a different way.",1

239, What's your opinion on investing in foreign stocks?,"We have a number of businesses that derive very significant percentages of their revenue from international operations. Coca-Cola earns 80% or more from their international operations; Gillette will earn two thirds or more from international operations, so we get a lot from outside the United States. It's a slight advantage to us having U.S.-domiciled companies. For instance, we get better treatment on the dividends if they are domestically based because of the way the U.S. tax laws go. But if Coca-Cola were domiciled in Amsterdam or if Gillette was in London, we would still be attracted to them to virtually the same degree we are now. We look at businesses domiciled outside this country--many don't meet our size requirements, but that's true here, too--but we have nothing against buying companies that are domiciled outside the United States.

So, for a stock with a $5 billion market cap, we’d have to report and likely run the stock up once we’d acquired only $150 million. But in the past, we’ve owned Guinness, which is now owned by Diageo, so this is not an overwhelming disadvantage. We’d be very comfortable owning many UK companies.Incidentally, contrary to what’s been reported, we do not have to report a 5% position within 10 days referring to reports in The Wall Street Journal and elsewhere that Berkshire would have to file on its recently disclosed purchase of Anheuser-Busch stock if it held more than 5% of the shares outstanding.I remember when I’d come back from Europe and couldn’t wait to convert my euros back to dollars.Europe isn’t doing as badly as you might think. Its growth rate is lower than ours, but our population is expanding a lot faster, so on a per capital basis, the gap is not as wide as you’d think.",1

At one time, we backed this up with $22 billion in foreign currencies, but then the carry made that an expensive way to express that belief, so now we buy into companies that earn a lot in foreign currencies. It’s a factor, but not a 50% factor, in what we buy.We’re following policies in this country that will lead to a decline in the dollar – the fundamental forces are fairly strong.We own one currency position right now that will surprise you – we’ll tell you about it next year. Look at oil going from $30 to $60 and the euro from 83 cents per dollar to $1.35, so the price of oil for Europeans has gone up very little – 25% vs. 100% for us.

There is a disadvantage being outside of the US. A few years ago we were looking to invest in either PetroChina or Yukos in Russia. We ended up picking PetroChina because the political situation was more stable. It turned out to be a good decision. I care about the country and the geopolitical environment I am investing in.The whole company was selling for $35 billion. It was selling for one-fourth of the price of Exxon, but was making profits equal to 80% of Exxon. I was reading the annual report one day and in it I saw a message from the Chairman saying that the company would pay out 45% of its profits as dividends. This was much more than any company like this, and I liked the reserves. If it were a US company, it would sell for $85 billion; it’s a good, solid company. I don’t understand the Chinese culture like I understand the US culture. However it said right in their annual report that they will payout 45% of their earnings as dividends, basically they say if they make money they will pay it out. I invested $450 million and its now worth $3.5 billion. I decided I’d rather be in China than Russia. I liked the investment climate better in China. In July, the owner of Yukos, Mikhail Khodorkovsky (at that time, the richest man in Russia) had breakfast with me and was asking for my consultation if they should expand into New York and if this was too onerous considering the SEC regulations. Four months later, Mikhail Khodorkovsky was in prison. Putin put him in. He took on Putin and lost. His decision on geopolitical thinking was wrong and now the company is finished. PetroChina was the superior investment choice. 45% was a crazy amount of dividends to offer but China kept its word. I am never quite as happy as I am in the US, because the laws are more uncertain elsewhere, but the point is to buy things cheap. Russia is just a bad geopolitical environment. On the other hand, China has kept their word on paying the dividends. In fact, when the dividends check comes in, it is calculated out 10 or so decimals, these guys keep their word. I don’t know the tax laws in China, but you can buy a good business cheap. At Berkshire Hathaway, you have to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to move the needle. We have a problem of finding things worth investing in.",1

As of yesterday, I agreed next March to go to India, because of what our Iscar business is doing there. India will grow, and Iscar belongs in every industrial country in world. We have good sized operation there. We don’t rule out India. Posco – they have big plans for India. Countries learn much from each other, and many have learned from USA. Maybe they can steal some ideas, and improve on us. We ought to figure out a lot of ways to do business in those countries. My preference is insurance which I understand. Both China and India do limit us right now, of what we can own and how much. Why put my managerial talent to work on something where we only own 20% vs 100%?

246, How large is the universe of companies whose intrinsic value you know? Why invest in South Korea or China?,"Our immediate decision is whether we can figure it out.

What is your best advice about obtaining acceptable information? There aren’t too many companies in Africa that are big enough for Berkshire to look at, except for maybe DeBeers, Anglo-American, or SAB Miller. Also, there isn’t a lot of information on these companies. I know South Africa has stock information available. The key is to get good information.In comparison, Korea has plenty of information available. There is Kissline online. Within seconds I can get Korean Stock Exchange Information, Annual and even quarterly information. I’m not sure if the same is available online for South Africa. This is OK because I don’t need to win every game, just the ones I play.I have three mailboxes in my office – IN, OUT, and TOO HARD. I was joking with the MIT students that I should have a TOO HARD bin and they made me one, so now I have it and I use it. I will only swing at pitches that I really like. If you do it 10 times in your life, you’ll be rich. You should approach investing like you have a punch card with 20 punch-outs, one for each trade in your life. I think people would be better off if they only had 10 opportunities to buy stocks throughout their lifetime. You know what would happen? They would make sure that each buy was a good one.

How is BRK positioned for currency failures? What is your advice to investors regarding the future of the Euro?","Charlie and I haven’t talked about Greece recently, I’m interested in his opinion. We have a lot of exposure in many countries, but we have it both on asset and liability side. We have much net worth in euro assets, but also substantial liabilities in Euro as well. When we reinsured Equitas we took on billions of liabilities around the world and we were paid in USD. If Euro depreciates we benefit with Equitas, but we lose on other areas. I can’t tell you our net exposure on Euro or Sterling on any given day, we have no dramatic exposures in any currency. Doesn’t mean it isn’t important. Charlie will now clearly explain how important the Greek situation is and its affect on the global economy. laughter. You have to distinguish between borrowers in their own currency (like US and Japan) and those who borrow in other currencies because creditors don’t trust them. When weaker credits borrow in other currencies, it can really put you out of business really quickly. They can’t print USD. That has caused failures. The EU – it is a really interesting situation. Greece is sovereign but can’t print their own currency – they have Euro. Euro was an experiment, and it is a test case playing out here – of a country using a common currency but is sovereign on promises to citizens. I don’t know how it ends, but I’m not forecasting anything – I just try not to watch movies like that. This will be high drama. We don’t make big currency plays, and we did one a few years ago and did okay. I would say this - that events of last few years make me more bearish on ALL currencies holding value over time. If you really could run deficits of 10% of GDP and do it a long time – world would have done it more, because that is really fun! Most understand it can’t be kept up. How world weans itself off deficit financing will be interesting to watch. As long as US borrows in USD, there is no possibility of default. If world won’t take USD debt, we have problem. You don’t default when you print your own currency. Published statistics are misleading. Debts are stated in government bonds outstanding. The unfunded promises are miles bigger than bonds outstanding. They don’t bind if you grow GDP at 3% per annum per person, but if you get to where growth stops, you will have enormous social strains, and god knows what the impacts will be.",1

In 1790, there were 4mil people in the US, and 290m in China. And there was very little growth in quality of living in China over those 200 years through 1990. They have major resources of land and minerals. Potential of Chinese is huge. Charlie and I are going over there at the end of September. They haven’t taught me how to eat Chinese food.

259, How will Buffett invest in China in the future? What will happen to the purchasing power of China’s large holdings in U.S. Treasuries?,"We respond to opportunities as we see them. We will see things to do over time. Some things are restricted to U.S. investors in China. We can’t own more than 24.9% of an insurance company in China. China is a huge market. We would have bought more than 10% of BYD, if they had let us. If we run a $250 billion trade deficit with China, they have $250 billion to do something with. The Chinese can’t get rid of their dollar holdings. Chinese dollar assets will increase as long as they run a trade surplus with the U.S. To date, they’ve acquired mostly U.S. government bonds. It’s a major problem for them to decide what to do with U.S. dollars. Anyone who owns dollar obligations outside the U.S. will have less purchasing power in the future. If I were a Chinese finance minister, I would do what they’re doing. China has one of the most progressive economic policies in the world. I have nothing but admiration for Chinese economic policies.

261, What are your thoughts about Japan?,"My thoughts about Japan? I am not a macro guy. Now I say to myself Berkshire Hathaway can borrow money in Japan for 10 years at one percent. One percent! I say gee, I took Graham's class 45 years ago and I have been working hard at this all my life maybe I can earn more than 1% annually, it doesn't seem impossible. I wouldn't want to get involved in currency risk, so it would have to be Yen-denominated. I would have to be in Japanese Real Estate or Japanese companies or something of the sort and all I have to do is beat one percent. That is all the money is going to cost me and I can get it for 10 years. So far I haven't found anything. It is kind of interesting. The Japanese businesses earn very low returns on equity - 4% to 5% - 6% on equity and it is very hard to earn a lot as an investor when the business you are in doesn't earn very much money.Now some people do it. In fact, I have a friend, Walter Schloss, who worked at Graham at the same time I did. And it was the first way I went at stocks to buy stocks selling way below working capital. A very cheap, quantitative approach to stocks. I call it the cigar butt approach to investing. You walk down the street and you look around for a cigar butt someplace. Finally you see one and it is soggy and kind of repulsive, but there is one puff left in it. So you pick it up and the puff is free--it is a cigar butt stock. You get one free puff on it and then you throw it away and try another one. It is not elegant. But it works. Those are low return businesses.But time is the friend of the wonderful business; it is the enemy of the lousy business. If you are in a lousy business for a long time, you will get a lousy result even if you buy it cheap. If you are in a wonderful business for a long time, even if you pay a little bit too much going in you will get a wonderful result if you stay in a long time.I find very few wonderful businesses in Japan at present. They may change the culture in some way so that management gets more share holder responsive over there and stock returns are higher. At the present time you will find a lot of low return businesses and that was true even when the Japanese economy was booming. It is amazing; they had an incredible market without incredible companies. They were incredible in terms of doing a lot of business, but they were not incredible in terms of the return on equity that they achieved and that has finally caught up with them. So we have so far done nothing there. But as long as money is 1% there, we will keep looking.",1
262, Does the Japanese economy affect your outlook?,"We don’t really concern ourselves with the macro issues. We can’t rely on the macro to bail us out of a wrong decision on a specific business.Look at See’s Candies. We bought it in 1972 and look what happened right afterwards. In 1973, the Arab oil embargo happened. Then inflation, followed by political turmoil. If we would have had a road map of 1972 to 1982, we’d have seen more inflation, a 20% prime rate, worldwide dissension. But knowing all those macro issues wouldn’t have helped us make a better decision to buy See’s Candies. It’s just more important to recognize a great business when you see it than it is to predict macro issues.",1
263, Is the individual investor even capable of assessing the riskiness of securities given the large number of institutions/hedge funds in the market?,"I don’t think there is much being overlooked now, but I’m forced to look at big things. That’s the advantage you have over me. A few years ago a friend of mine mentioned that I should look at Korea. We bought Posco for 3-4 times post-tax earnings. I found 20 other companies selling at 2-3 times earnings and strong balance sheets. I diversified because I didn’t know the Korean market as well. We are looking for the very unusual. Occasionally things will happen in a securities market that are extraordinary. I like shooting fish in a barrel, but I like to make sure the water’s drained out.We had that situation a few years ago with the 30 year versus 29 ½ year Treasury bonds. Because of less liquidity, the off-the-run bonds were selling for 30 basis points less, which translates into 3% of principal value. LTCM entered the trade at 10 basis points originally, but they overleveraged and were forced to unwind the position. If you went long/short you could make money really quickly.Markets are efficient most of the time about most things. But for these opportunities, nobody will tell you about them. They won’t be on CNBC and they won’t be in brokerage reports. You have to go find them yourself. In 1951, after I graduated from school, I used Moody’s and S&P manuals as my sources of information. I went through them page by page. I was like a basketball coach looking for 7-footers. I still have to find out if he’s coordinated, and can stay in school. But if someone comes up to me that’s 5’6” and says, “Wait ‘til you see me handle the ball”, I say “No thanks”. On page 1443 of Moody’s, I found Western Insurance Securities. It had earned $21.66 per share 2 years ago, and earned $29.09 last year. Over the past year the stock was selling for between $3 and $13 per share. I still had to do the work to make sure the earnings were valid. The markets will get it right eventually. But they are there. You don’t have to find too many. Finding 10 of these opportunities in your lifetime will make you so rich. But you can’t be wrong. You can’t have any zeroes. A list of big numbers multiplied by zero will equal zero. You can’t go back to “Go”.",1
264, What do you think about all the money flowing into private equity and hedge funds? And do you see the future of buying businesses changing based o­n the considerable increase in private equity activity?,"I'll tell you what I think of hedge funds. Hedge funds are a huge fad. You can pick any ten hedge funds and I'll bet that o­n average they will underperform the S&P over the next ten years. You can't create more money out of American business than the business itself creates; so most of these hedge funds will not be able to justify their outlandish fees over the long-term and they will disappear. o­n Wall Street, there are innovators, imitators, and total incompetents.

268, Advice for finding good investment advisors?,"The question of finding investment advisors is a hard one. When I was winding up my partnership in the early 1970s, I was returning a fair amount of capital to people, and they asked me what to do with it. I recommended two people who I felt were exceptionally good and honest: Sandy Gottesman(http://www.forbes.com/finance/mktguideapps/personinfo/FromMktGuideIdPersonTearsheet.jhtml?passedMktGuideId=424148), who just joined Berkshire’s board, and Bill Ruane of the Sequoia Fund(http://www.sequoiafund.com/). They were contemporaries of mine, so I knew their results and how they’d achieved them, which is critical. I don’t know today’s managers, so I can’t recommend anyone.The fact that I only knew two shows the difficulties of finding someone good. The promotional types going around to institutions today are not likely to be good – or have high integrity.I read an article(http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB108327930536798024-search,00.html?collec%E2%80%A6utowire%2F30day&vql_string=google+and+brin%3Cin%3E%28article%2Dbody%29) in the Wall Street Journal last week about the two fellows who founded Google and all the problems they’ll have with their new-found riches – I almost sent a sympathy card. Laughter. They don’t have a big problem. They’re smarter than the people coming to them. The people with the problem are the people trying to sell them services and want to convince them that they have a problem.It’s merchandising. You don’t need these people at all in investing – all these professionals who say you’re going to be in big trouble if you don’t listen to them. They’re selling.It reminds me of when I asked my former brother-in-law: “How do you get farmers to pay you to sell their cow to Swift or Armour?” He replied, “Warren, it’s not how you sell ‘em, it’s how you tell ‘em.”The Investment Advisory BusinessHedge FundsI think people who invest in hedge funds, in aggregate, are unlikely to do well. Hedge funds are in the midst of a fad. It’s distinguished by an extraordinary amount of fees. If the world is paying hedge funds 2% and a percentage of the profits, and the losers fade away, then it won’t be good for all investors. Obviously, some will do well, but not in aggregate.Maybe high fees are what the traffic can bear, but that reflects an attitude. It’s a basically unfair arrangement. In effect, hedge fund managers are getting four times standard fees. And I’d bet they don’t have all of their own money in their own funds.Charlie and I both ran partnerships that would generally be classified as hedge funds. There are some similarities, but I don’t think we had quite the same attitude that the present managers have.The fund of funds stuff – it’s really unbelievable, piling on the layers of costs. People don’t become geniuses because on the door it says “hedge fund.” But they may be good at marketing – in fact, if they’re good at this, they don’t need to be good at anything else.",1

The ones who come here to the Berkshire annual meeting are the best of them, so don’t judge the class by the ones here.The best thing you can do as you think about following in Warren’s footsteps is to reduce your expectations. If your wife is going to have a baby, you’d be better to call an obstetrician than do it yourself. If your pipes leak, you should call a plumber. Most professions add value beyond what the average person can do for themselves. But in aggregate, the investment profession does not do this – despite $140 billion in total annual compensation. It’s hard to think of another business like that. Can you, Charlie?. I can’t think of any. It’s become a bigger and bigger business. And the more you charge, the more money you bring in. It’s useful to get into a business like that. When I speak to students, I ask them to name a great business. One answer is running a business school, because the amount you charge is a sign of prestige. No one wants to go to the business school that charges $20,000 in tuition, but if the school charges $40,000, more do.In the investment field, you now have large portions of investment managers that charge fees that, in aggregate, cannot work out for investors. Obviously, some investments in high-fee managers do work out well. But you can’t pay 2 and 20 2% annual management fee and 20% of the profits, standard for private-equity and hedge funds, in which you pay the manager 20% of the profits if they make money and, if they don’t, they just close up and reopen later. If you charge this in an economy that’s only growing a few percent a year, the math doesn’t work. The question for you is how to pick out the exceptions e.g., the managers who will outperform, even after fees. Everyone who calls on you says they are the exceptions.I will bet you that if you name any 10 partnerships with over $500 million in assets and put them up against the S&P 500, they will trail the S&P, after fees, over time.If you know enough about the person and how they’ve done in the past, you can occasionally find someone. But if you’re running a big pension fund, with everyone calling on you, you will likely invest in the best salespeople. I think it ought to be a crime for an investment manager or his agent to entertain a state pension-fund manager, and it should be a crime for that person to accept it.The whole concept of the house advantage is an interesting one in modern money management.

I can see how it destroys a lot of value through the high cost producer once they are not protected by a monopoly territory.I don't for sure see who benefits and how much. Obviously the guy with very low cost power or some guy has hydro-power at two cents a KwH has a huge advantage.

281, What do you think of utilities?,"The production of electricity is a huge business and it's not inconceivable that we'd invest heavily here.The Public Utilities Holding Company Act PUCA, written in 1935, has a lot of rules about what the parent company of a utility can do. It was set up to check abuses that existed then, so it was appropriate at the time. But I don't think there's anything pro-social about limiting Berkshire Hathaway's ability to acquire utilities today. We might have done one or two acquisitions in past years but for PUCA.Regarding the Californian Power Crisis With deregulation, the incentives for power producers were changed such that instead of wanting abundant supplies, they wanted tight supplies, which would result in higher prices.You can't take utilities with a cost of X, invite new producers in with a cost of 3X, and expect prices to go down.The old system strikes me as better for society.---------------------------------------------------Re: How Technological Change Might Affect the Utilities BusinessWe’re going to earn a return on capital employed whether we transmit it the old way or whether some new way emerges. We strive to serve our customers and keep their costs down as much as possible.Even in terms of choosing which generating sources we use, we follow the will of the people in the states we serve. If they want to pick a more expensive way to generate for some reason, that’s okay with us. I don’t think anything will change our economics. We certainly don’t buy a utility expecting to do something else with it.",1

It's interesting how regional tastes can be: Dr. Pepper may have a far bigger market share in Texas than in Minnesota.You can make money with a soft drink company that doesn't dominate the business. You can do a lot better with one that does dominate, but it's not winner take all. It's not like two newspapers in a town of 100,000 or 200,000.

286, What do you think of the banking business model?,"  Banking is a good business - many banks earn high returns on tangible equity*   “Charlie and I have been surprised at how much profitability banks have, given that it seems like a commodity business.”*   Underestimated how sticky customers are and how unaware they are of fees banks charge them*   WFC - $4.00 per share after full taxes on $15 of tangible equity*   If you have a well run bank, you don’t need to be the #1 bank in an area*   Bank ROA is not highly correlated to size*   You may have to pay 3x tangible equity to buy a bank*   Only problem with banks is that sometimes they get crazy and do dumb things.’91 was a good example*   If a bank doesn’t do dumb things on the asset side, it will make good money------------------------------------------------We've been somewhat surprised at how well banks have done. Some have generated 20% or greater returns on tangible equity over many years, though this is in part due to increasing leverage.. ""We misdiagnosed it and, even worse than that, we haven't changed.""------------------------------------------------Banking, if you can just stay away from following the fads and making bad loans, has been a remarkably good business. Since WW II, ROE for banks that have stayed out of trouble has been good. Some large well-run banks earn 20% ROE. I've been surprised that margins in banking haven't been competed away.It's pretty extraordinary that institutions competing against each other without real competitive advantages can all make high returns. Part of it is higher loan to value ratios than in past years. Some banks get into trouble making bad loans, but you don't have to.------------------------------------------------Financial companies are more difficult to analyze than other companies. They can report whatever earnings they want – it’s an easy game to play. For banks, earnings depend on loans and the reserves set aside. It’s easy to change and manipulate the reserves.With a company like WD-40 or a brick company, the financials are easy to analyze. But with financial companies it’s tough, especially when you throw in derivatives.There were very high grade, financially sophisticated people who were on the boards of the GSEs Government-Sponsored Enterprises, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and they were not negligent, but it’s very tough to detect the shenanigans that went on.Charlie and I were on the board of Salomon and Charlie was on the audit committee, and it’s just impossible to evaluate thousands of transactions. You’ll just have to accept that with insurance companies, banks and other financial companies – it’s just a more dangerous field to analyze.With GEICO it’s easier because the statistics are quite accurate – it’s short-tailed insurance. It’s not like asbestos.I wouldn’t fault the ratings agencies. Even the big-name auditors didn’t catch it.------------------------------------------------Q - Small regional banks - what would you look at before you buy?. It is hard to make a categorical decision about regional banks. So much depends on the character of the institution. It will be a reflection of the CEO you have. A bank can mean anything. It can be an institution that is doing all sorts of crazy things. The Bank of Commonwealth was an example. We owned a bank in Rockford, Illinois, run by Dean Aback—he would always run a super, sound bank. You should know the culture of the management and the institution before making the decision to buy a bank. We own Wells Fargo and M&T, but it doesn’t mean they are immune. But likely they are immune from institutional stupidity. There was a wise man that said there are more banks than bankers. If you think about that a while, you will get my point. That is a wildly bullish statement from Charlie. I may need to go start buying! laughter",1
287, You’ve recently invested in Goldman Sachs and GE. Is the financial sector a good buy right now?,"No sector is a good buy unless you understand the business. However, I do believe that there is good value and great opportunity now in the financial sector because it is extremely unpopular. Sector’s themselves don’t make good buys, companies that are undervalued make good buys. You know how to value a business, you project the future cash flows discounted to present and buy with a margin of safety. The earnings prospects need to be greater than the current value. Anything that is unpopular is always great to look at. If I was getting out of school right now, I would take a look.",1
288, Your opinion of the gambling industry?,"I don’t know about which stocks to recommend, but, as long as we’re talking about the legal ones, gambling companies will have a perfectly good future. The desire of people to gamble is very high, including in stocks. Day trading comes very close to gambling. People like to gamble. If there’s a football game, especially if it’s boring, you’ll enjoy it more if you bet a few bucks. The human propensity to gamble is huge.When it was only legal in Nevada, you had to travel or break laws to gamble, but now states are legalizing it. The easier it is, the more people who will gamble. I bought a slot machine a long time ago and put it on the 3rd floor of my house. I could then give my children any allowance they wanted, as long as it was in dimes, and I’d have it all back by nightfall. I wanted to teach them a good lesson. My slot machine had a terrible payout ratio, by the way. LaughterPeople will always want to gamble. I’m not a prude about it, but to quite an extent, gambling is a tax on ignorance. You just put it in and guys like me don’t pay the taxes – it relieves taxes on those who don’t gamble. I find it socially revolting when a government preys on its citizens rather than serving them. A government shouldn’t make it easy for people to take their social security checks and waste them pulling a handle. It’s not government at its best. I think other negative social things flow from gambling over time. I would argue that casinos use clever psychological tricks to get people to gamble, some of which are harmless, but a lot of grievous injury has been done. You won’t find a lot of gambling companies in Berkshire’s portfolio. Applause",1

But Charlie runs a hospital, so maybe he'll have some insights.. The quality of the medical care delivered, including the pharmaceutical industry, has improved a lot.

291," Berkshire has invested in several insurance companies, would you go into the health insurance business?","No. Health insurance is so ingrained into national policy that it is a tough business. It’s pretty adversarial. I’m not really that excited about it from a business perspective. I don’t want to write policies with high loan loss ratios.

294, What do you think of the telecoms industry?,"I don't have the faintest idea how to evaluate what telecom companies will look like down the road. I only understand a little of what they do. I suppose if you gave me some information, I could regurgitate it back to you but in terms of understanding their economic characteristics down the road, I don't know. Charlie, what do you know about the telecom business?Then you're in trouble. I know people will be drinking Coke, using Gillette blades and eating Snickers bars in 10-20 years and have rough idea of how much profit they'll be making. But I don't know anything about telecom.It doesn't bother me. Somebody will make money on cocoa beans, but not me. I don't worry about what I don't know -- I worry about being sure about what I do know.We might buy some junk bonds in that business telecom, and we have, but we expect losses in junk bonds -- though we expect a decent result -- because we're dealing with institutions that have demonstrated problems. In some cases -- not at all with Level 3 -- there are management issues. We expect to have significant losses, and we haven't seen our biggest loss yet, believe me. It's like being an insurer of substandard risks -- you'll have more accidents, but can charge a premium.We don't buy businesses in which 15 will be train wrecks and 85 will work out OK.There are all kinds of businesses where you can't predict what they're going to earn, so we try to favor a few where we can.At Level 3, they are fine people and they acknowledge that they borrowed too much money.

296, Your opinion on the auto industry?,"GM CEO Rick Waggoner and Ford Chairman Bill Ford have both been handed, by past managers, extremely difficult hands to play. They’re not the consequences of their own doing, but they have inherited a legacy cost structure, with contracts put in place decades ago, that make it very difficult for them to be competitive in today’s world.GM and Ford don’t sign long-term contracts to pay high amounts for steel, but that’s what they’ve done with annuity and healthcare payments to employees. The result is such expenses are far higher than that of competitors, so it’s not a fair fight.GM once had 50% market share, and it’s fallen to 25%. Even if it was still 50%, they’d still be in trouble.I’m not sure what I’d do if I was elected CEO of GM. It reminds me of what Bill Buckley said when asked what he would do if he actually won his race for New York mayor back in 1965 and he said, “The first thing I’d do is ask for a recount.” (Laughter) Well, that’s what I’d do at GM.The UAW says, “We have a contract and we have a deal.” GM has set aside $90 billion for pensions and another $20 billion or so for healthcare, yet has a market cap of only $14 billion. That’s not sustainable. Something will have to give.If a company had to pay an extra $2,000 per car more for steel, everyone would realize there was a crisis and demand a quick solution, but that’s not happening.Part of the problem arose because the actions of previous managements bore no accounting consequences. Back in the 1960s, companies didn’t have to account for pension costs on an accrual basis, and didn’t have to do so for healthcare costs until the late 80s or early 90s. But those costs are very real.",1

There’s an evolutionary situation with newspapers. I read five a day and so does Charlie. We’ll be the last people reading a newspaper, with a land line by our sides. laughter Most newspapers in the U.S. we would not buy at any price. Twenty to forty years ago, they were essential to customers and advertisers. They had pricing power, but they’ve lost their essential nature—essentiality has eroded. Erosion accelerated dramatically, and it won’t end based on anything on the horizon. We do not see anything to reverse it. They are essential to advertisers only as long as they’re essential to readers. Ten years ago, the head of The Buffalo News said that on an economic basis, Berkshire should sell The Buffalo News. We could have sold the business for hundreds of millions. Not so today. As long as we’re not losing money forever and there are no union problems, we won’t sell. There are around 1,400 daily U.S. papers, and nobody has found the model that works. We’ll play it out as long as we can. One hundred percent right. Monopoly daily newspapers were impregnable.

Ipad and other e-reading technologies – will it end up with contraction in earnings retained by content provider or by distributor?.

298, What's your view of the newspaper industry? versus other media?,"People will always want to be entertained and informed, but the choices for doing so were far fewer 50 or 60 years ago. As the years have gone by, technology has produced a variety of new ways to be informed or entertained, but we still only have two eyeballs and 24 hours per day. And any time there’s more competition, generally that’s bad for business.Newspapers are still highly profitable, especially compared to tangible capital employed, but the outlook isn’t nearly as rosy as it was 20-30 years ago. The audience is going down and that has to erode the economics over time. People also like to talk about how more competition is good for business, but it’s not true.At one time, the major television networks had a license from the government and were the only three highways to the eyeballs of hundreds of millions of people for advertisers like GM, Ford and Gillette to choose from. But now there are many highways. It’s hard to imagine these businesses the networks getting better in aggregate over time.The key would have been to buy the NFL National Football League; e.g., content at inception.We still own World Book encyclopedias. At one time, we sold 300,000 sets for $600 each. The problem is that with the advent of the Internet you could get a good bit of the same information without cutting down tress, delivering the books, etc. The problem wasn’t that the product wasn’t worth the money, it’s that people have other alternatives. I don’t see anything that will change this.What multiple would you pay for a business earning $100 million, which is going down 5% per year, versus the same business with earnings growing 5% per year? I’m not saying those are the numbers I’d use for newspapers, by the way. I do not think newspaper circulation, or ad pages, will be larger in five years – even in areas of the country that are growing in population.Newspaper multiples are uncomfortably high if you believe profits are going to decline. Prices today do not reflect earnings declining at 5-6% per year. There’s also the risk that owners of newspaper businesses don’t fully recognize the situation and will buy other newspapers at too high a price.This comes from someone who loves newspapers and couldn’t do without them. I read five newspapers every day. Charlie does too. But people can do without them. The decline, if anything, has accelerated somewhat. When they take people to the cemetery, they’re losing readers, but when they graduate from college, they’re not gaining any readers. The virtuous cycle isn’t true anymore, but prices don’t reflect this.We love them as products and thought they were the greatest of companies with bulletproof franchises. We were wrong.It used to be the easiest business model to understand.In the 1991 annual report, I wrote about advertising preprints, and how there was nothing magical about the newspaper, but that it brought the preprints inside the house. I’m not sure what Buffett was talking about here – the word “preprint” doesn’t appear in the 1989-1992 annual reports, but his discussion in his 1991 letter of the declining economics of the media business is fascinating and his conclusion was amazingly prescient: “Most media properties continue to have far better economic characteristics than those possessed by the average American business. But gone are the days of bullet-proof franchises and cornucopian economics.”It has been interesting for me to watch both direct owners and investors in the newspaper business resist seeing what’s right in front of them. It newspapers’ superior economics went so long the other way. You couldn’t make a mistake buying a monopoly newspaper business meaning a town in which there was only one newspaper until 1975 or 1980.---------------------------------------------------What advice do you have for long-suffering New York Times shareholders and what do you think of its dual-class share structure?As for the “long suffering”, as you put it, shareholders of the New York Times, I don’t blame the Sulzbergers for what’s happened. Here is the bio of Arthur Sulzberger Jr., the Chairman and Publisher of the New York Times Co., and here is a 2005 BusinessWeek article about the family, the company and the challenges they face. We’ve said for a long time that we thought newspapers were overpriced because investors were looking in the rear-view mirror.As for different share classes which the NYT has, I own about 30% of Berkshire A and B shares, so there’s no voting difference.The woes of the newspaper business have nothing to do with the dual-class structure.Let’s suppose Mr. Gutenberg Johannes Gutenberg was the inventor of modern printing in the 1500s actually 1400s; he lived 1400-1468 had become a day trader or hedge fund manager instead, so that we never had printing. But along came the Internet and cable TV as we have today. Now imagine that someone came along saying, “I have a great idea: let’s chop trees down, buy expensive printing presses and buy a fleet of delivery trucks, all to get pieces of paper to people to read about what happened yesterday.” I don’t think we’d be backing him. Buffett’s point is that if newspapers didn’t exist, no one would create them now.It happened that newspapers came first and people have become accustomed to them. They have momentum on their side from the past, but I don’t care how smart you are, you’re not going to be able to do much to reverse their decline.Some smart guy came to the Los Angeles Times and said he was going to take circulation up to 1.5 million. Well, it’s now at 800,000. I don’t know if even William Randolph Hearst could do much to change this.The same thing happened to us with the World Book Encyclopedia – its sales have dropped from 300,000 to 22,000.The companies that have not had dual-class structures have fared just as badly. For example, we own The Buffalo News, and earnings are down 40% from the peak. Despite terrific management and high market share, earnings are going down. It’s a fact of life. There’s an evolutionary situation with newspapers. I read five a day and so does Charlie. We’ll be the last people reading a newspaper, with a land line by our sides. laughter Most newspapers in the U.S. we would not buy at any price. Twenty to forty years ago, they were essential to customers and advertisers. They had pricing power, but they’ve lost their essential nature—essentiality has eroded.

Our newspaper hit 300k at peak on Sunday, and now down 100k. Philadelphia, was down 40k in a single year. The advertiser doesn’t need you. Your ability to price evaporates. We met Lord Thompson who owned paper in Council Bluffs. We asked him, “Have you ever been there?” “I wouldn’t dream of it” he said. We asked, “You seem to increase price every year. What can they do about it?” He replied “Nothing, I tell my US managers to price to make 40% pretax and above that it may be gouging. Politicians are not behaving better as newspapers are weakening. We are going to miss the newspapers’ power.",1
299, What are your views on the railroad industry?,"I don’t think the railroad industry will be a lot more exciting, but the competitive position of the railroads has improved somewhat since 20 years ago. There’s been progress on labor issues and an improved competitive position vis-a-vis truckers. Higher oil prices hurt railroads, but hurt truckers more by a factor of four. What was a terrible business 30 years ago, operating under heavy regulation, has become decent and could be better over time. But it will never be a fabulous business – it’s too capital intensive.",1
300, When do you expect to see a return on investment in wind farms and other alternative energy sources?,"Berkshire subsidiaries will be leaders in practically anything that makes sense for utilities. You bought a pipeline in about two hours, didn’t you?  Berkshire subsidiaries will be leaders in practically anything that makes sense for utilities. You bought a pipeline in about two hours, didn’t you?",0
301, When do you expect to see a return on investment in wind farms and other alternative energy sources?,"We have the largest wind farm capacity in the country. We are a net exporter of wind energy in Iowa. Iowa has been very receptive and progressive in wind energy. We haven’t raised rates in Iowa in about 10 years. We can use Iowa’s tax credits. We’ve developed a lot at PacifiCorp in wind. You’ll see more and more wind generation by MidAmerican Energy Holdings. A durable advantage is that we can act fast. We went from a noontime phone call to a formal offer for Constellation Energy by that evening. It didn’t work out. We don’t ask the lawyers before we do it, we just do it. We can move fast when the time is right. We’ve got the money, and we’ve got the managers to handle the properties.Comment - If Berkshire has the largest wind generating capacity in the country, somebody needs to tell FPL Group, which makes the same claim. To date, wind power has been the most successful among the alternative energy sources.",1
302, What industry will be the next growth driver in the 21st century and what do you see that supports that?,"We don’t worry too much about that. If you’d look at the 1930s, nobody could have predicted how much the automobile and airplane would transform the world. There were 2000 car companies, but now only 3 left in the US and they are hanging on barely. It was tremendous for society, but horrible for investors. Investors would have had to not only identify the right companies, but also identify the right time. The net wealth creation in airlines since Orville Wright has been next to zero. If a capitalist had been at Kitty Hawk and shot him down, would have done us a huge favor. Or look at TV manufacturers. There are hundreds of millions of TV’s, RCA & GE used to produce them, but now there are no American manufacturers left.If you want a great business, take Coca-Cola. The product is unchanged, they sell 1.5 billion 8 ounce servings per day 122 years later. They have a moat; if you have a castle, someone’s going to come after you.Gillette accounts for 70% of razor sales at 80% gross margins and it is the same over time. Men don’t change much. Shaving might be the only creative thing they do, like painting the Sistine Chapel.Snickers has been the #1 candy bar for the past 40 years. If you gave me $1 billion to knock off Snickers, I can’t do it. That’s the test of a good business. You don’t knock off Coke or Gilette. Richard Branson is a marketing genius. He came in with Virgin Cola, we’re not sure what the name means, perhaps it turns you back into one, but he couldn’t knock off Coke. We look for wide moats around great economic castles. Growth is good too, but we prefer strong economics. In the upcoming annual report I have a section titled “The Great, the Good, and the Gruesome” where I talk about these.",1
303, What was your thinking behind the purchase of Berkshire Hathaway?,"Well in 1962 I learned from Ben Graham how to assess businesses. He also had the cigar butt analogy for buying businesses.you can usually get one good puff out of it and it’s free. Berkshire made a lot of money after WWII (more than Pfizer and Merck) and then it steadily went downhill. Between 1955 and 1965 Berkshire went from 12 mills to 2 mills and they bought their own stock as mills closed. We bought 100,000 shares out of 1 million in 1962 at $7 3/8 and the company had $10-11/share in working capital.I knew I wouldn’t lose money because of the working capital. It was losing money but it was also liquefying assets by closing mills. Seabury Stanton was running Berkshire at the time and I went to go visit him. We had an agreement that Berkshire would tender $11-1/2 for my shares of the company. At this point, I could not buy any stock as I had inside information. A few weeks later I received a letter from Old Colony Trust containing a tender offer of $11-3/8. Early the following week, Seabury tendered the stock at 11 3/8. As result, I began buying more Berkshire. Other family members of Seabury Stanton sold their shares to me and I gained controlling interest in the company. The family members weren’t very happy with Seabury either really. We ran the mills until 1985.See’s Candy is an example of low rate of return on capital expenditures individually yet the company as a whole makes loads of money because of the great brand of See’s. We bought See’s in 1972 and every year since then we have raised the prices the day after Christmas and it never hurt the business. When we invest we ask one question, how long do you have to wait to raise the prices? If you are an airline today and you try to raise your prices, an hour later, you will be lowering them because of competition. Not the case with a good brand like See’s. If I were to give you a $100 million, I’m not going to, but if I did, you could not damage the See’s brand in the minds of 30 or so million Californians. Only See’s can do that. Their brand is their promise to provide the quality and service that people have grown to expect.",1
304, What is your analysis of Coca-Cola?,"Well, basically I love it, but because the market for Coca-Cola products will grow far faster over the next twenty years internationally than it will in the United States. It will grow in the U.S. on a per capita basis. The fact that it will be a tough period for who knows—three months or three years—but it won’t be tough for twenty years. People will still be going to be working productively around the world and they are going to find this is a bargain product in terms of a portion of their working day that they have to give up in order to have one of these, better yet, five of them a day like I do.This is a product that in 1936 when I first bought 6 of those for a quarter and sold them for a nickel each. It was in a 6.5 oz bottle and you paid a two cents deposit on the bottle. That was a 6.5 oz. bottle for a nickel at that time; it is now a 12 oz. can which if you buy it on Weekends or if you buy it in bigger quantities, so much money doesn’t go to packaging—you essentially can buy the 12 ozs. for not much more than 20 cents. So you are paying not much more than twice the per oz. price of 1936. This is a product that has gotten cheaper and cheaper relative to people’s earning power over the years. And which people love. And in 200 countries, you have the per capita consumption use going up every year for a product that is over 100 years old that dominates the market. That is unbelievable.One thing that people don’t understand is one thing that makes this product worth 10s and 10s of billions of dollars is one simple fact about really all colas, but we will call it Coca-Cola for the moment. It happens to be a name that I like. Cola has no taste memory. You can drink one of these at 9 O’clock, 10 O’clock, 1 O’clock and 5 O’clock. The one at 5 o’clock will taste as good to you as the one you drank early in the morning, you can’t do that with Cream Soda, Root Beer, Orange, Grape. All of those things accumulate on you. Most foods and beverages accumulate; you get sick of them after a while. And if you eat See’s Candy—we get these people who go to work for us at See’s Candy and the first day they go crazy, but after a week they are eating the same amount as if they were buying it, because chocolate accumulates on you. There is no taste memory to Cola and that means you get people around the world who will be heavy users—who will drink five a day, or for Diet Coke, 7 or even 8 a day. They will never do that with other products. So you get this incredible per capita consumption. The average person in this part of the world or maybe a little north of here drinks 64 ozs. of liquid a day. You can have 64 ozs. of that be Coke and you will not get fed up with Coke if you like it to start with in the least. But if you do that with anything else; if you eat just one product all day, you will get a little sick of it after a while.It is a huge factor. So today over 1 billion of Coca-Cola product servings will be sold in the world and that will grow year by year. It will grow in every country virtually, and it will grow on a per capita basis. And twenty years from now it will grow a lot faster internationally than in the U.S., so I really like that market better, because there is more growth there over time. But it will hurt them in the short term right now, but that doesn’t mean anything. Coca-Cola went public in 1919; the stock sold for $40 per share. The Chandler family bought the whole business for $2,000 back in the late 1880s. So now he goes public in 1919, $40 per share. One year later it is selling for $19 per share. It has gone down 50% in one year. You might think it is some kind of disaster and you might think sugar prices increased and the bottlers were rebellious. And a whole bunch of things. You can always find reasons that weren't the ideal moment to buy it. Years later you would have seen the Great Depression, WW II and sugar rationing and thermonuclear weapons and the whole thing—there is always a reason.But in the end if you had bought one share at $40 per share and reinvested the dividends, it would be worth $5 million now ($40 compounding at 14.63% for 86 years!). That factor so overrides anything else. If you are right about the business you will make a lot of money. The timing part of it is very tricky thing so I don’t worry about any given event if I got a wonderful business what it does next year or something of the sort. Price controls have been in this country at various times and that has fouled up even the best of businesses. I wouldn’t be able to raise prices Dec31st on See’s Candy.But that doesn’t make it a lousy business if that happens to happen, because you are not going to have price controls forever. We had price controls in the early 70s.The wonderful business—you can figure what will happen, you can’t figure out when it will happen. You don’t want to focus too much on when but you want to focus on what. If you are right about what, you don’t have to worry about when very much.---------------------------------------------------Coca-Cola is a fabulous company. It will sell over 21 billion cases of all of its products around the world and that goes up every year. It’s a really wonderful business that sold at a silly price a few years ago. The stock sold at $80 in the late 1990s when earnings were $1.50. Earnings are higher quality today at $2.18 per share in 2005, while the stock trades around $43. Every year, Coke accounts for a little greater percentage of the liquids consumed in the world.It has $5-6 billion of tangible assets and makes a similar amount of pre-tax earnings. There are not a lot of big businesses that earn 100% returns on tangible assets.The stock was ridiculously overvalued, but you can’t blame CEO Neville Isdell today for that. You can fault me for not selling at 50x earnings.I expect we’ll own it 10 years from now.",1

306, Is it really a good idea to buy stocks in unhealthy products? e.g. Coca-Cola,"I’ve been drinking five cokes a day for years and I feel terrific.We passed one time on the chance to buy a terrific business, even after we spent the time and met management. They were fine people, but we didn’t want to be in the business. But we’d buy stock in the business.I initially thought Buffett might be referring to UST, but a friend emailed me the following: “The company was Conwood in the late 1980s. Conwood was shopping itself to avoid a raider that it didn't want to get involved with. It eventually went private with the Pritzker family of Chicago. Buffett discussed this at a meeting some years back. I think he said he passed on owning the whole thing because of the even slight risk that he'd have to spend any of his time with lawyers suing the company.” Another friend added, “Interestingly, Conwood has been gaining market share at UST’s expense ever since then, and also collected a huge antitrust judgment against UST a year or two ago. So as usual, WEB and CM were right when they identified it as a terrific business many years ago. But I have no regrets that they passed on the deal. Apart from the moral grounds, we don't need the legal risk.”I don’t have any problem with buying stock or bonds of companies that engage in activities that I wouldn’t endorse myself, but I’d have a problem with owning outright and directing the activities myself.Every retailer sells cigarettes, but it doesn’t bother me to own the retailer.. But you wouldn’t own the company that made the tobacco or the advertisements.Yes. I can’t tell you why I draw the line there, but I do. One time, I owned the bonds of RJR, and I’d still do it, but I would not buy the company. We walked away from one situation like this – we were thinking about it…. We didn’t think very long. We don’t claim to have perfect morals, but at least we have a huge area of things that, while legal, are beneath us. We won’t do them. Currently, there’s a culture in America that says that anything that won’t send you to prison is OK.Eating hamburgers or drinking Coke – that’s a choice. If one lives to 75 eating what they want or 85 eating carrots and broccoli – who’s lived a better life? I know where I come out on that. Laughter.I’ve never been near a Whole Foods Market.Charlie and I never disagree on where to eat.Laughter.",1
307, How do you distinguish the Cokes of the world from the Proctor & Gambles of this world?,"Well, P&G is a very, very good business with strong distribution capability and lots of brand names, but if you ask me and I am going to go away for twenty years and put all my family’s net worth into one business, would I rather have P&G or Coke? Actually P&G is more diversified among product line, but I would feel more sure of Coke than P&G. I wouldn’t be unhappy if someone told me I had to own P&G during the twenty-year period. I mean that would be in my top 5 percent. Because they are not going to get killed, but I would feel better about the unit growth and pricing power of a Coke over twenty or thirty years.Right now the pricing power might be tough, but you think a billion servings a day for a penny each or $10 million per day. We own 8% of that, so that is $800,000 per day for Berkshire Hathaway. You could get another penny out of the stuff. It doesn’t seem impossible. I think it is worth a penny more. Right now it would be a mistake to try and get it in most markets. But over time, Coke will make more per serving than it does now. Twenty years from now I guarantee they will make more per serving, and they will be selling a whole lot more servings. I don't know how many or how much more, but I know that.P&G's main products--I don't think they have the kind of dominance, and they don't have the kind of unit growth, but they are good businesses. I would not be unhappy if you told me that I had to put my family's net worth into P&G and that was the only stock I would own. I might prefer some other name, but there are not 100 other names I would prefer.",1
308, Opinion on Coke and Gillette? (2002),"Coke's market share is about 50% of the worldwide soft drink business, and Gillette has about 71% by revenues of the worldwide razor blade business -- both are higher than they were when I called their businesses 'inevitables' five years ago.With the world's population growing 2% annually, it is crazy to think they can grow profits at 15-18% per year, or even 10%, when unit grow is sure to be slower. But people got carried away, due to Wall Street and to some extent, company pronouncements.---------------------------------------------------When I talked about Coca Cola being an ""inevitable,"" I talked about the probabilities that Coke will dominate the global market for soft drinks. I don't think anything will change that. It has a huge distribution system and position in people's minds worldwide. They'll make a little more profit per drink sold over time as well. I don't know how anyone could dethrone them.",1
309, Coke and Gillette are off something like 30% from their highs. Do you still consider them exciting businesses?,"We don’t want to dart in and out of businesses we love. It’s too hard to get the timing right, and then there’s the problem of taxes.Coke and Gillette have both had their disappointments. It happens. It’s not in the nature of everything to go right all the time in a straight line.

310, What did you think of the Calpers/ISS proposal that you should not be on Coke’s audit committee?,"A shareholder asked what Buffett thought of the Calpers/ISS proposal that he should not be on Coke’s audit committee. (From a Forbes article(http://www.forbes.com/markets/bonds/newswire/2004/05/02/rtr1355987.html): “The California Public Employees Retirement System, or Calpers, and investor advisory group Institutional Shareholder Services argued that votes for Buffett for the Coke board should be withheld because Berkshire subsidiaries, such as ice cream chain Dairy Queen and food distributor McLane Co., do business with the world's largest soft drink maker… In defending the decision last month, an ISS spokesman said the group didn't want Buffett off the board entirely, just off of the audit committee, which should operate with zero tolerance for any conflicts. The spokesman said they don't make exceptions for anyone, even Buffett.”) Buffett replied:I would say that whoever suggested that should do 500 sit-ups this was a reference to a skit in the movie shown before the meeting, in which Arnold Schwarzenegger punishes Buffett for talking about raising taxes in California by making him to do 500 sit-ups.Actually, Charlie and I have encouraged the idea that shareholders should behave like owners, not sheep – where, in too many cases, they’ve been shorn. Big institutional shareholders have too long sat on the sidelines when they should have been active. Now that they’re finally waking up, the question is: Can they behave like intelligent owners? In last year or two, as they’ve woken up, they’ve searched for checklists, but frankly, a checklist is no substitute for thinking. Bertrand Russell once said: “Most men would rather die than think. Many do.”A board’s real job is to find the right CEO and prevent him or her from overreaching. Not much else matters.I think it’s absolutely silly, if Berkshire Hathaway owns 200 million shares of Coke worth $10 billion, to think that because Berkshire Hathaway sells a few hours of flight training to Coke, that I’m conflicted. It's almost absurd that people don't understand proportionality at all.I receive $100,000 per year to sit on Coke’s board. This is obviously a tiny amount of money to me. If we picked someone from the welfare line and gave them the same money, this would represent all of their income, yet they’d be considered independent, but they wouldn’t really be. This thinking is kind of silly.I encourage institutions and large owners to behave like owners and think carefully about what causes to take on.. The cause of reform is hurt not helped when an activist makes an idiotic suggestion like saying that having Warren on the board of Coke is contrary to the interests of Coke. Nutty behavior undermines their cause.It’s like having a slicing machine in an apple orchard. The machine picks up things like rocks, so you program it to slice only red round things, but when red balloons come down the conveyor belt, the machine doesn’t know what to make of it.Institutions are coming around to new ways of thinking. Hopefully, with evolution, they’ll think about what’s actually good for the shareholders of the company.",1
311, Does McDonald's have the ability to dominate like a Coca-Cola or a Gillette?,"In the annual report we talked about Coca-Cola and Gillette in terms of their base business as being what I call the Inevitables, and that related to obviously the soft-drink business in the case of Coca-Cola and razors in the case of Gillette. It doesn't necessarily extend to everything they do, but fortunately in both those companies those are very important products. I would say that in the food business, you would never get the total certainty of dominance that you would get in products like Coca-Cola and Gillette. People move around in the food business from where they eat. They may favor McDonald's, but they will go to different places at different times. If someone starts shaving with a Gillette Sensor Plus, they won't go elsewhere in my view. You'd never get in the food business in my judgment quite the inevitability you would get in the soft-drink business with a Coca-Cola. You'll never get it again in the soft-drink business. I mean, it took 111 years to get to the point where they are. The infrastructure is just incredible. So I wouldn't put McDonald's in the same class in terms of inevitability. That doesn't mean it couldn't be an even better stock investment, depending on the price. But you're not going to get the price from me and knowing Charlie I doubt that you'll get the price from him but I'll give him a chance. (Munger remains silent; Buffett holds a hand-held mirror up to Munger's face and announces ""He's breathing, folks, he's breathing."" Crowd laughter.)",1

313, Would you buy McDonald’s and go away for twenty years?,"McDonald’s has a lot of things going for it, particularly abroad again. Thee position abroad in many countries is stronger than it is here. It is a tougher business over time. People don't want to be eating--exception to the kids when they are giving away beanie babies or something--at McDonald’s every day. If people drink five Cokes a day, they probably will drink five of them tomorrow. The fast food business is tougher than that but if you had to pick one hand to have in the fast food business, which is going to be a huge business worldwide, you would pick McDonald’s. I mean it has the strongest position.It doesn't win taste test with adults. It does very well with children and it does fine with adults, but it is not like it is a clear winner. And it is gotten into the game in recent years of being more price promotional--you remember the experiment a year ago or so. It has gotten more dependent on that rather than selling the product by itself. I like the product by itself. I feel better about Gillette if people buy the Mach 3 because they like the Mach 3 than if they get a Beanie Baby with it. So I think fundamentally it is a stronger product if that is the case. And that is probably the case.We own a lot of Gillette and you can sleep pretty well at night if you think of a couple billion men with their hair growing on their faces. It is growing all night while you sleep. Women have two legs, it is even better. So it beats counting sheep. And those are the kinds of business.(you look for). But what type of promotion am I going to put out there against Burger King next month or what if they sign up Disney and I don't get Disney? I like the products that stand alone absent price promotion or appeals although you can build a very good business based on that. And McDonald’s is a terrific business. It is not as good a business as Coke. There really hardly are any. It is a very good business and if you bet on one company in that field bet on (garbled) McDonald’s. We bought Dairy Queen a while back that is why I am plugging it shamelessly here.back to the questions.(https://buffettfaq.com/#questions)You won't get the Inevitable in food that you will get in a single consumer product, such as blades. If I'm using a Gillette blade today, chances are I'll buy the next generation that comes out. A very high percentage of people who shave (including women) are happy with the product--it's not expensive--and if you're getting a great result, you're not going to fool around. Whereas, a great many decisions on fast food are based on which one you see. Convenience is a huge factor. So if you are going by a McDonald's or a Burger King or a Wendy's, and you happen to be hungry, you may very well stop at the one you see. So there's a loyalty factor, but it's just not going to be the same in food. People want to vary where they eat. Well, I don't, I'm happy to eat at McDonald's every day. They don't really have the same desire to vary their soft drink. So no knock on McDonald's; it's just the nature of the kind of industry they're in. Charlie?It's price sensitive, too.Yeah, the average person in the United States buys 27 Sensor Excels in a year, one roughly every 13 days. I don't know what the retail price is, because they give them free to us as directors (laughter), but if they're a dollar that makes it 27 bucks. Around the world, people are using cheap double edged blades, and they'll keep moving up the comfort scale ladder and Gillette is a direct beneficiary. The difference between having great shaves and so-so shaves and pocks and nicks and scratches is 10 or 12 bucks a year. That is not the type of cost that'll make people change their habits.",1

315, Opinion of Procter & Gamble?,"It’s clear that it’s a consumer powerhouse of sorts and Gillette, in its field, has about as strong a consumer franchise as you’ll ever see (the blades and razors part of it).Retailers are becoming more concentrated and brands of their own, so the struggle between manufacturers and retailers will continue. If I were on either side, I’d want to strengthen my hand by getting bigger. I think P&G and Gillette will be stronger as a combined enterprise, given the strength of the Wal-Marts and Costcos of the world.I don’t know a thing about P&G’s pharmaceutical business.

317, Reasoning behind the PetroChina investment?,"PetroChina is not opaque. It’s very similar to big oil companies elsewhere in the world. It’s the 4th most profitable oil company in the world – it produces as much crude as Exxon. It’s not complicated – it’s a big integrated oil company, so it’s fairly easy to get your mind around the economics of the business.The annual report will tell you more about the business than the annual reports of other oil giants. They tell you they’ll pay out 45% of their earnings, barring the unexpected. I like knowing that that cash will come to Berkshire.It was bought because it was very, very cheap by any metric – far cheaper than Exxon, BP, Shell.You could say it should be cheaper, given that it’s 90% owned by the government of China, which is a factor, yes, but not so big for me. If you read the annual report of PetroChina, you’ll have as good an understanding of the company as reading the annual report any other oil company. Then, you can think about risks such as a disruption of US-China relations.There’s Yukos, the big oil company in Russia. In evaluating country risk, you can reach your own judgments. In our view, PetroChina had less risk.Later in the meeting, Buffett and Munger returned to the discussion of this company:You don’t need any blinding insights to invest in PetroChina. They’re producing 2.5% of the world’s oil, it’s priced in US dollars, they control a significant part of the refining in China, and they pay out 45% of their earnings in dividends. If you’re buying something like that at 1/3 the valuation of comparable companies, it’s not hard. You just have to do the work.---------------------------------------------------We bought it a few years ago, investing $400 million. It was my first investment in a Chinese stock.I read the annual report. They produce 3% of the world’s oil, about 80% as much as Exxon Mobil. Last year, it earned $12 billion in profit – only maybe five US companies earned as much last year.The total market value when I bought it was around $35 billion, so I paid only three times last year’s earnings. The company does not have unusually large amounts of leverage and – this is unusual – has a stated policy of paying out 45% of its earnings in cash, so that’s a 15% cash yield based on last year’s earnings, since Berkshire bought it at 3x those earnings.The Chinese government owns 90% and we own 1.3%, so if we vote with them, together we control the business. (Laughter)Unfortunately, we don’t own the same shares as the Chinese government. We own another class of shares such that we had to report our interest in the company at 1.3%. We would have liked to buy more, but the price jumped up after our ownership stake was disclosed.I simply read the annual report. I had no contact with management nor did I attend any management presentations. I just sat in my office and invested $400 million, which is worth $1.2 billion today.I also looked at Yukos, the big Russian oil company at the time I bought PetroChina and compared the two at the time. PetroChina was far cheaper and I thought the economic climate was likely to be better in China. Yes, there was risk of tax laws or ownership rights changing, but the price was ridiculous.---------------------------------------------------Q - In 2002, you invested in PetroChina and all you did was read the annual report. Most professional investors have more resources at hand. Wouldn’t you want to do more research? What do you look for in an annual like that? How could you make the investment only on a report?. I read it in the spring of 2002, and I never asked anyone else their opinion. I thought it was worth $100 billion after reading the report. I then checked the price, and it was selling for $35 billion. What is the sense of talking to management? It doesn’t make any difference. If the market value was $40 billion, you would need to refine the analysis. We don’t like things you have to carry out to 3 decimal places. If someone weighed somewhere between 300-350 pounds, I wouldn’t need precision — I would know they were fat. If you can’t make a decision on PetroChina off the figures, you go on to the next one. You weren’t going to learn more if you thought their big oil field was going to decline out slightly faster, etc. I met Dr. Gao recently from the China Investment Corp. for lunch. I was very impressed with him. We had lunch in Omaha. PetroChina was a $35 billion company when we bought and I thought it was worth $100 billion. When oil was at $70-75 per barrel, the analysis was the same but I then thought it was worth about $275-300 billion. That is about where it was then trading, so we sold. It went up significantly after- wards because of the A-share listing, and at one point, it became the most valuable company in the world by market cap. They’ve done a terrific job. If it went to a significant discount, we would buy again. I’m not so sure we don’t have a lot to learn from China vs. what we have to teach. China has a remarkable society. I traveled 45 minutes outside of Dalian, and saw hundreds of plants that were developed in recent years. The Chinese are starting to realize their potential. There is lots of ability, but the system did not realize its potential. I think it will continue to get better. I would look for the best practices and I would discard the rest. If you look at effective individuals—why do people want to be around them? You should copy those qualities. I would look for what I admire and emulate it, and try not to let distasteful things be copied. I hope you will go back to China and tell them that you found one individual that really approves of Confucius’ respect for elderly males.",1

319, Reasoning behind the National Indemnity investment?,"We are very big in insurance and having the wrong incentives in place could be very harmful.Buffett had prepared slides and had them put up on the screens in the convention center. Slide 1 showed Berkshire Hathaway’s balance sheet shortly before it bought National Indemnity.For 15 minutes each year, Jack Greenwald the owner of National Indemnity would get frustrated with something and want to sell his company. I told Charlie that the next time he was in heat, bring him to me. So, we bought it in ’67 for $7 million.Slide 2 showed premium volume for National Indemnity from 1980 through 2003. It was $80 million in 1980, rose to $366 million in 1986, then declined nearly every year down to $54 million in 1999, and then spiked up to $595 million in 2003. Buffett highlighted the decline from 1986 to 1999 and asked:How many public companies in America would see premiums go down every year for such an extended period?Slide 3 showed the number of employees at National Indemnity from 1980-2003. The number rose from 1980-86 and then declined from 1986-99, but much more slowly than premiums declined. Buffett noted:We never fired anyone – the decline in headcount was solely due to retirements. The key is you can’t fire people if they don’t write business, or they’ll write business. You must be able to tell them that if they write no business, their job is not in jeopardy.Slide 4 showed National Indemnity’s expense ratio from 1980-2003, which was as low as 25.9% in a peak year, and as high as 41% in the worst year, 1999. Buffett noted that:Some companies would feel that this is unacceptable. We don’t. We can take an expense ratio that’s out of line, but can’t take writing bad business.Slide 5 showed the combined ratio at National Indemnity from 1980-2003. The combined ratio exceed 100 during a few bad years for the industry in the early 1980s, which is what led to the hard market that peaked in 1986, but National Indemnity’s combined ratio has been below 100 – e.g., the business has been profitable – in every year for the past 20. Buffett pointed out:In 1986, our combined ratio was only 69.3 because we did the most volume ever that year, up to that point the company has done more volume in the past few years. We coined money when we wrote a lot of business, and made a little when we didn’t. We’re the only company like this. We’ll have a high expense ratio when business is slow.National Indemnity was a no-name company when we bought it, and has no copyrights, patents, etc. to distinguish it, but they have a record like no-one else because they had discipline.You can’t run an auto or steel company this way, but it’s the best way to run an insurance company.",1

321, Reasoning behind the HomeServices investment?,"HomeServices will grow. It owns 15-16 local real estate firms, which retain all of their local identities – akin to the whole Berkshire model. Managers operate them as if they owned them themselves. We have no national identity, unlike Cendant, which operates under a few big names.There’s no question that we’ll buy a few – or a lot – of real estate brokerage companies over the next 10 years. It’s a great company with great management. Last year, we participated in $50 billion of transactions – but this was only a small percentage of the national total. We’re big in California, Minnesota and Nebraska.It’s a good business, but very cyclical. It’s very good now. We’ll go through a bad period, but we’ll keep buying. I don’t know how big it will become, but it’s conceivable that as we grow, we’ll add things like buying furniture. When people buy a new house, they need a lot of things.In response to another question about whether the internet will threaten the commission structure of real estate brokers like HomeServices, Buffett replied:I think commissions in HomeServices are sustainable. Barry Diller is interested in the space via Lending Tree, and the internet is a threat to any business, including real estate brokerage. But when I think about the process of owning a home, the for-sale-by-owner (FSBO) was with us 50 years ago and it is now but it hasn’t affected commissions. My guess is that 30 years from now, a very significant percentage of home sales will be done through the brokerage system like today’s, though there are people trying to change it.---------------------------------------------------We don’t think the way homes are bought and sold will change very much. Some will disagree, but we don’t think the internet will change this. Buying and selling a home is the biggest financial decision most people will make and people will continue to want to have a 1-on-1 relationship with a real estate broker. It also will be a local business, so we’ve retained the local identities.It’s almost certain that we’ll be a lot bigger in this business in 5-10 years. It depends on how many acquisitions we make, but we’re a good buyer and owner.",1
322, Reasoning behind the Geico investment? (and thoughts on low cost producers),"The idea of direct marketing in auto insurance at GEICO came from Leo Goodwin and his wife. They came from USAA, which was established because US military personnel moved around a lot and had trouble getting insurance. Leo took this idea and broadened it beyond military officers. It’s a better system.Going back 100 years, auto insurance was sold by casualty companies via a system of agents that charged large commissions. It was a cartel. State Farm was formed in the 1920s and had the idea of a captive agency force, which brought down costs. It became the largest auto insurer, and Allstate because #2 following the same model. This was a better system.Leo bypassed the agents and brought down costs even further.Every American family has to buy auto insurance. It’s not a luxury item, so cost is key and the low cost is going to win. The direct sellers, GEICO and Progressive, will slug it out and will win. GEICO has a tough competitor in Progressive – they’ve seen how we’ve done it the direct model and are moving to it.Dell is very efficient. I’d hate to compete with them. If they turn out a decent competitive product at a good price, that system will win.Charlie is on the board of Costco. Costco and Wal-Mart have figured out how to do this be ultra-low-cost and they’re winning.It’s always a good idea to go with the low-cost producer over time. Being the low-cost producer of something that people need is a good business.---------------------------------------------------Right after yearend, we completed the purchase of 100% of GEICO, the seventh largest auto insurer in the United States, with about 3.7 million cars insured. I’ve had a 45-year association with GEICO, and though the story has been told before, it’s worth a short recap here.I attended Columbia University’s business school in 1950-51, not because I cared about the degree it offered, but because I wanted to study under Ben Graham, then teaching there. The time I spent in Ben’s classes was a personal high, and quickly induced me to learn all I could about my hero. I turned first to Who’s Who in America, finding there, among other things, that Ben was Chairman of Government Employees Insurance Company, to me an unknown company in an unfamiliar industry.A librarian next referred me to Best’s Fire and Casualty insurance manual, where I learned that GEICO was based in Washington, DC. So on a Saturday in January, 1951, I took the train to Washington and headed for GEICO’s downtown headquarters. To my dismay, the building was closed, but I pounded on the door until a custodian appeared. I asked this puzzled fellow if there was anyone in the office I could talk to, and he said he’d seen one man working on the sixth floor.And thus I met Lorimer Davidson, Assistant to the President, who was later to become CEO. Though my only credentials were that I was a student of Graham’s, “Davy” graciously spent four hours or so showering me with both kindness and instruction. No one has ever received a better half-day course in how the insurance industry functions nor in the factors that enable one company to excel over others. As Davy made clear, GEICO’s method of selling – direct marketing – gave it an enormous cost advantage over competitors that sold through agents, a form of distribution so ingrained in the business of these insurers that it was impossible for them to give it up. After my session with Davy, I was more excited about GEICO than I have ever been about a stock.When I finished at Columbia some months later and returned to Omaha to sell securities, I naturally focused almost exclusively on GEICO. My first sales call – on my Aunt Alice, who always supported me 100% – was successful. But I was then a skinny, unpolished 20-year-old who looked about 17, and my pitch usually failed. Undaunted, I wrote a short report late in 1951 about GEICO for “The Security I Like Best” column in The Commercial and Financial Chronicle, a leading financial publication of the time. More important, I bought stock for my own account.You may think this odd, but I have kept copies of every tax return I filed, starting with the return for 1944. Checking back, I find that I purchased GEICO shares on four occasions during 1951, the last purchase being made on September 26. This pattern of persistence suggests to me that my tendency toward self-intoxication was developed early. I probably came back on that September day from unsuccessfully trying to sell some prospect and decided – despite my already having more than 50% of my net worth in GEICO – to load up further. In any event, I accumulated 350 shares of GEICO during the year, at a cost of $10,282. At yearend, this holding was worth $13,125, more than 65% of my net worth.You can see why GEICO was my first business love. Furthermore, just to complete this stroll down memory lane, I should add that I earned most of the funds I used to buy GEICO shares by delivering The Washington Post, the chief product of a company that much later made it possible for Berkshire to turn $10 million into $500 million.Alas, I sold my entire GEICO position in 1952 for $15,259, primarily to switch into Western Insurance Securities. This act of infidelity can partially be excused by the fact that Western was selling for slightly more than one times its current earnings, a p/e ratio that for some reason caught my eye. But in the next 20 years, the GEICO stock I sold grew in value to about $1.3 million, which taught me a lesson about the inadvisability of selling a stake in an identifiably-wonderful company.In the early 1970’s, after Davy retired, the executives running GEICO made some serious errors in estimating their claims costs, a mistake that led the company to underprice its policies – and that almost caused it to go bankrupt. The company was saved only because Jack Byrne came in as CEO in 1976 and took drastic remedial measures.Because I believed both in Jack and in GEICO’s fundamental competitive strength, Berkshire purchased a large interest in the company during the second half of 1976, and also made smaller purchases later. By yearend 1980, we had put $45.7 million into GEICO and owned 33.3% of its shares. During the next 15 years, we did not make further purchases. Our interest in the company, nonetheless, grew to about 50% because it was a big repurchaser of its own shares.Then, in 1995, we agreed to pay $2.3 billion for the half of the company we didn’t own. That is a steep price. But it gives us full ownership of a growing enterprise whose business remains exceptional for precisely the same reasons that prevailed in 1951. In addition, GEICO has two extraordinary managers: Tony Nicely, who runs the insurance side of the operation, and Lou Simpson, who runs investments.Tony, 52, has been with GEICO for 34 years. There’s no one I would rather have managing GEICO’s insurance operation. He has brains, energy, integrity and focus. If we’re lucky, he’ll stay another 34 years.Lou runs investments just as ably. Between 1980 and 1995, the equities under Lou’s management returned an average of 22.8% annually vs. 15.7% for the S&P. Lou takes the same conservative, concentrated approach to investments that we do at Berkshire, and it is an enormous plus for us to have him on board. One point that goes beyond Lou’s GEICO work: His presence on the scene assures us that Berkshire would have an extraordinary professional immediately available to handle its investments if something were to happen to Charlie and me.GEICO, of course, must continue both to attract good policyholders and keep them happy. It must also reserve and price properly. But the ultimate key to the company’s success is its rock-bottom operating costs, which virtually no competitor can match. In 1995, moreover, Tony and his management team pushed underwriting and loss adjustment expenses down further to 23.6% of premiums, nearly one percentage point below 1994’s ratio. In business, I look for economic castles protected by unbreachable “moats.” Thanks to Tony and his management team, GEICO’s moat widened in 1995.Finally, let me bring you up to date on Davy. He’s now 93 and remains my friend and teacher. He continues to pay close attention to GEICO and has always been there when the company’s CEOs – Jack Byrne, Bill Snyder and Tony – have needed him. Our acquisition of 100% of GEICO caused Davy to incur a large tax. Characteristically, he still warmly supported the transaction.Davy has been one of my heroes for the 45 years I’ve known him, and he’s never let me down. You should understand that Berkshire would not be where it is today if Davy had not been so generous with his time on a cold Saturday in 1951. I’ve often thanked him privately, but it is fitting that I use this report to thank him on behalf of Berkshire’s shareholders.",1

324, Reasoning behind the Iscar acquisition?,"We acquired a large, extremely well managed company called Iscar. Last October, I’d never heard of this company, but then I got a 1 1⁄2 page letter from Eitan pronounced “Ay-tohn” Wertheimer. Sometimes I get a letter and a person’s character and intellect jump off the page at me. So I met Eitan and his top managers in Omaha. They subsequently met Charlie. This all came to fruition yesterday when we signed the deal. Click here(http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/news/may0506.html) to read the press release.As hard as this is to believe, Charlie is as enthusiastic about this as I am.I’d like Eitan and his two managers to stand up. Jacob Harpaz is President and CEO. Danny Goldman is CFO. Take a good look at these people – they’re going to do very, very well for you.Eitan Wertheimer: It’s a beautiful day in Omaha. We bring our family to a new home. I bring more than 5,000 people here, and their families. For years, we weren’t sure what to do in terms of monetizing our ownership of Iscar. Then someone came to me and said, “Have you heard of Berkshire?” We found that Berkshire, like us, is a family company with a strong culture. And Berkshire is run by young people who we’d like to work with for 20-25 years. Laughter We had a very interesting lesson from Warren and then Charlie – and we survived! More laughterI represent a big family. We make cutting tools and molds for cars, washing machines, the mold for Coke bottles, etc. I want to thank our customers, not only for buying from us but for trying new things. We try to stay competitive.This is Jacob. In reality, my job is not to disturb him. Jacob gently fired me many years ago.The company is 34 years old. We’re in 61 countries around the world. We have to fulfill a lot of expectations and work very hard to make sure everyone in this room is glad that we joined the family. Let’s be successful and look to the future. Every year, I look forward to coming to Omaha when the fields are green and the days get longer.At this point, on the main screen, there was a 10-15 minute movie about Iscar and its many worldwide subsidiaries, products and markets. The company makes all kinds of highly specialized cutting tools that are used in a wide range of industries, including automobiles and aerospace. The movie also touched on the history of the company, which was founded in the mid-1950s by Stef Wertheimer, Eitan’s father, who is currently honorary Chairman.This is an important acquisition. We paid $4 billion for 80% of the company. It’s the first business we’ve purchased that is based outside the U.S., though many we’ve purchased have major operations outside the U.S.I think you’ll look back at this in 5 to 10 years as a very significant event in Berkshire’s history.This was, in effect, a very public wedding: both sides making vows of lifelong love, loyalty and commitment, in front of a vast number of friends, family and witnesses. In addition, the press in Israel has been remarkable. Here’s an excerpt from one article:Prime Minister Ehud Olmert called Eitan Wertheimer last night to congratulate him on the sale. “It’s terrific tidings and a great gift to the State of Israel,” Olmert said. “We tip our hat to you, personally and in the name of the whole country.”Eitan Wertheimer said selling the company for him is “lighting an economic torch,” just as his father Stef lit a torch on Independence Day. According to him, Buffett’s expression of faith is an important declaration for the country, “and just as they talked about the Balfour Declaration – now they’ll talk about the Buffett Declaration.” Olmert will speak with Buffett today. A government source said Olmert was indirectly involved in the deal.A friend observed this and (correctly) commented:The huge edge Buffett has built is represented in the phenomenal global celebration of the Iscar acquisition.Eitan Wertheimer is now a hero and favored son of the state of Israel and, in selling his company to Buffett, he has achieved a phenomenal stature relative to his peers. Selling to Bain Capital would have not gotten anywhere this level of press, nor generated a call from the Prime Minister.Is this level of instant global recognition worth offering Mr. Buffett a price he can’t refuse? You betcha! Watch the global competition to be the next ‘Omaha Idol’ heat right up!! What an edge!---------------------------------------------------Buffett talked about the trip he and Munger made to Israel to visit Iscar and they showed some photos of their visit to Iscar’s major plant, which is located only 10 miles or so from the Lebanese border. They were incredibly impressed. Munger commented: “It was a great experience. I have never seen anything as automated as that Iscar operation. I think they view it as a disgrace if any human hand has to do anything.”---------------------------------------------------Q - Chinese tungsten prices are going up — will this have an impact on Iscar’s machine tool production?. The reason the Iscar plant was built in China was to serve China. It’s growing. It’s nice to be near a raw material, but the geographic plant decision has nothing to do with changes in the price of the product. If you are creating a higher value-added product like Iscar, there may be a three-to-six-month adjustment to raw material prices, but there won’t be substitutes for tungsten as a raw material for cutting tools in the near term. Raw materials do get passed through. In the carpet business, oil-based raw materials are having more trouble passing costs. Over time it will pass through. But we’d be having trouble in that anyway. This candy will reflect sugar and cocoa over time. You can have squeezes here and there, but it’s not a big deal. When I visited the facility in Dalian, I had very high expectations for Iscar and they’ve been exceeded in every way; both financial and human expectations. I would say that the short answer is that while we don’t like inflation because it is bad for our country and civilization, we will probably make more money over time because there is inflation.",1
325, Update on NetJets,"Yes, but I believe the episode should be reviewed in context. If we buy 30 businesses and let the managers run them without interference, where 95% of the time it works well, then it is not a bad failure record. So, they will not change the management approach at all. They will continue to trust people to manage their own companies. This is how it has worked for years.

326, Update on NetJets,"NetJets has grown rapidly and so far our expenses have grown faster. We have top service, the only worldwide service and the only service with larger planes. I thought we’d have economies of scale, but if anything we’ve had diseconomies of scale. I could give you reasons, but Rich Santulli knows the business and is addressing it. He works 16 hours a day. There is no one I have greater confidence in to fix this business. High fuel costs are a pass-through but affect the business. I think it’ll be profitable before long, but I’ve been wrong so far.We have a good business. Nearly everyone who wants a large plane comes to us. We are able to get full price, but expenses got out of control last year. You can hold me accountable for paying a lot of money for the business a number of years ago and we haven’t made any money yet.I looked at Raytheon’s annual report and they lost a lot of money in this area, but they’re selling their own planes so maybe they don’t care.. The product integrity is so extreme between NetJets and its competition. For example, NetJets’ pilots are subjected to real oxygen withdrawal so they’ll recognize the symptoms. Not everybody does that because it’s expensive. They’re obsessive about product integrity. My guess is that this will be rewarded eventually.----------------------------------------------------Q - What errors were committed? What was learned and how do you prevent it from happening again?. I probably won't. Mistakes will be made over time. Sometimes situations are extraordinary. We were buying at fictitious plane prices that were based on how much people thought they could be sold for vs. what we would later sell them for. In the end they were not prepared for what was obviously happening and we had to write down a lot of the planes. They also let operating costs get out of line with revenues. Remember that I stayed in the textiles business for 20 years before I finally woke up. Charlie was telling me it was lousy in year one. It was a big mistake. NetJets last year posted a $711m loss. It is now operating with a decent pretax profit, with well over $50m pretax profit in Q1 and not with any boom in plane sales. They have a new business plan that has no diminution of service or safety but is now more in line with revenues. David Sokol turned the place around like no one could have. This doesn't change our management strategy. We let managers do their stuff. And we will keep doing it.",1
327, What was the thinking behind the McLane purchase?,"Yesterday we announced a deal to buy McLane from Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart announced that the price for the two deals it did -- one was a small trucking company -- was $1.5 billion. It's been reported that the purchase price McLane was $1.45 billion. McLane is a wholesaler to convenience stores, quick-serve restaurants, Wal-Mart, movie theaters and so forth. It will have about $22 billion in revenues this year. Wal-Mart had owned it since 1990 and it grew substantially while they owned it. It is run by a terrific manager, Grady Rosier, and under his leadership, it grew from $3 billion to $22 billion.Wal-Mart, for very good reasons, wants to specialize on what they do extremely well. We were approached by Goldman Sachs to buy the business a week ago. It makes sense for both sides. It was a sideline business for Wal-Mart. Their ownership of McLane resulted in certain people who would be logical customers not to do business with McLane because they didn't want to do business with a competitor. We'll be seeing them soon to explain that they can sleep well at night buying from us.A representative of Wal-Mart, the CFO, came up to Omaha last Thursday. In one hour, we had a deal and shook hands, and when you shake hands with Wal-Mart, the deal is done. There needs to be regulatory review, but we fully expect that in just a few weeks, McLane will become part of Berkshire.It serves presently 36,000 of the 125,000 convenience stores in the United States, and has 58% share among the largest chains. To each store, it sells about $300,000 of products/year. McLane also serves 18,000 quick-serve restaurants, mainly those operated by YUM Brands (Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and KFC).It's a tough business. You have Hershey and Mars on one side and 7-11 Eleven on the other side, so you have to work hard to earn 1% pretax. Tilson - If McLane earns 1% pre-tax on $22 billion in sales, that's $220 million, so Buffett may have bought this business for 6.6x pre-tax earnings. I think this is a good price, especially if the business can grow substantially under Berkshire, but not a steal -- the guys at Wal-Mart aren't fools. But I think they let it go for a below-market price to Buffett because their biggest concern is that the business continue to be a reliable supplier to their stores. Such a low-margin business has little room for error, and it could get into trouble (as other similar companies have) under the ownership of a financial buyer that used too much leverage or tried to tinker with its operations.",1

329, How did the Clayton Homes purchase come about?,"Clayton Homes is the class of the manufactured home industry. The deal came about in an unusual way. Every year, a class (about 40 students) from the University of Tennessee comes to Omaha. They visit some sights and then we a have classroom session for a couple of hours. Afterward, they typically give me a football or basketball. Last year, Bill Gates happened to be in town. This year, we had a good session and when they got through, they gave me a book, the autobiography of Jim Clayton, the founder of Clayton Homes. He'd written a nice inscription. I said to the students that I was an admirer of Jim's. I read the book and called Kevin Clayton, Jim's son, and said how much I'd enjoyed his dad's book. I said if they ever decided to do anything regarding selling the company, we'd be interested and I told him what price I'd be willing to pay. A few phone calls later, we had a deal. That's the way things tend to happen at Berkshire.The manufactured home industry got in a lot of trouble. They'd gone crazy with credit and when you go crazy with credit, you get into a lot of trouble. Look at Conseco and Oakwood, which went into bankruptcy. The industry lost the ability to securitize receivables and was in the tank. There were 160,000 new manufactured homes this year, but there were 90,000 repossessions, so this hurts demand. For the strong, like Clayton, especially with a backer like Berkshire, it should be a good time in the industry. And it's a big industry -- about 20% of new homes are manufactured. We can put you in one for $30/square foot. Compare the prices -- that's a deal.Competitors admit that Clayton is the class of the field, but even for Clayton, financing was hard. The lenders had gotten burned. Clayton did a securitization earlier this year, but to get the deal done, they had to keep more of the risk on their booksLater in the meeting, in response to a question, Buffett commented further on Clayton Homes: In the manufactured housing industry, everyone is losing money, but Clayton is making money. Most of Clayton's houses are sold through 297 outlets that they own. Managers are in a 50/50 profit split with Clayton. This is unlike what was going on in the industry a few years ago, whereby dealers would have a floor plan and the manufactured housing company would finance 130% of the purchase price, so the dealer would bring in any warm body. The system was designed for disaster. At Clayton, if a dealer takes in an inadequate down payments, it's his problem and he has to take care of repossessing it. This creates the right incentives.If you read Jim Clayton's book First A Dream, he tells about the first home he sold when working for someone else and all of the funny business and gaming of the financing. These activities are coming home to roost in a huge way among the manufacturers and those who financed them. There's such a stain that Clayton is only one that can securitize, and without us, not to the extent they wanted. They are a class player and have the right systems in place with the right incentives. We will not securitize -- we will keep it for the portfolio.You're right he was speaking to the questioner that if you see companies with lots of gains on sales, be suspicious.---------------------------------------------------The manufactured-home industry has an interesting history. There have been years in which manufactured housing accounted for 20% of the new housing stock built in this country, but it’s now at the lowest level it’s been in 40 years. It’s fallen to 6-7% of new housing starts in the past few years, despite considerably better quality – you can look at the two Clayton Homes houses on the exhibition floor of the Qwest Center. They cost only $45 per square foot. That’s good value.There’s been resistance by local builders to manufactured housing, but we’ve made progress. They’re now building subdivisions for manufactured housing.For quite some time until the crash in this industry a few years ago, the houses were mis-sold. The retailers were selling the houses to people who shouldn’t have been buying them, getting the down payment, and then taking the loans and selling them to some insurance company who lost a lot of money. The subsequent crash created a hangover that’s still being worked through.Mortgages on manufactured homes should be financed on shorter terms. Terms of 30 years are a mistake. The terms got very lax and we’re bearing the consequences.Somewhere down the road there will be 200,000 units of manufactured housing sold, but not in the next year or two.The number of competitors is down. Clayton’s record is so much better than anyone else’s that you have to look hard for the #2 player. Clayton may become biggest homebuilder in the U.S.",1

331, Thinking behind the investment in Anheuser-Busch?,"Most of the time, our actual decision to buy takes about two seconds. In the case of Anheuser- Busch, I bought 100 shares 25 years ago so that I would get the annual reports (you get the annual reports a little quicker if you own the stock in your own name). So, I’ve been reading the company’s annual reports for 25 years. Recently, beer sales have been flat. Wine and spirits are growing, at the expense of beer, and Miller has been rejuvenated to some degree. So, Anheuser-Busch has been experiencing very flat earnings; they’ve had to spend more to maintain share and even do a bit of promotional pricing. They are going through a period that is certainly less fun for them than was the case a few years ago.It’s been a fascinating industry over the past 50 years. Omaha used to be a brewing town and Storz beer had 50% of the local market, but then the national brands took over.Anheuser-Busch will have a strong position for a long time. The beer business is not going to grow significantly in the U.S., but worldwide beer is popular in a great many places, and Anheuser-Busch has a very strong position. I would not expect the earnings to do much for some time, but that’s fine with us.That’s true for Berkshire too.In beer, you don’t see the rise of generic brands, as we’ve seen in so many other categories. But beer consumption per capita is going nowhere.Americans drink about 64 ounces of liquid per day. 27% of that is soda (11 ounces are Coke products), beer is about 10% and, despite the rise of Starbucks, a fine company, coffee has gone down and down over time.Schlitz used to be the #1 brand of beer.There’s a great book on the history of the beer industry he didn’t give the title, though mentioned it was written by a Wall Street Journal reporter. Most likely it is Travels with Barley: A Journey Through Beer Culture in America, by Ken Wells.",1
332, Could you talk us through your thinking of the acquisition of Larson-Juhl?,"On December 17, 2001, Berkshire Hathaway announced that it was acquiring Albecca (known as Larson-Juhl), the nation's leading provider of custom picture frames. Buffett was asked to talk about this business (these comments are from the annual meeting, plus those made at another presentation):Craig Ponzio, the owner of Larson-Juhl called me, told me about his business, its sustainable competitive advantages, its financial characteristics, and the price he wanted. Shortly thereafter, he came to visit me at 9am and by 10:30 we had a deal. I haven't seen him since.The company has $300 million in revenues, earns $50 million in pre-tax profits, ties up no capital, is growing slowly, and distributes every dime of profit.There are about 18,000 picture framing shops in the United States, mostly very small businesses with a few hundred thousand dollars per year in sales. They can't afford to have much inventory, so they show a catalogue to a customer who chooses the frame. Then, if they call Larson-Juhl before 3pm, 85% of the time the frame will be there the next day. Larson-Juhl and its customers are focused on service, not price.Larson-Juhl calls on its 18,000 customers an average of five times/year. It has an incredible distribution system. Tell me how you'd attack that business? You wouldn't want to anyway, as the market's not big enough. Larson-Juhl has a HUGE moat. I always ask myself how much it would cost to compete effectively with a business. With businesses like these, nothing's going to go wrong. If you bought 20 of them, 19 of them would work out well.Craig wanted to sell to me because he didn't want to waste a year doing a deal that might fall through at the end. With us, it's 100% certain that the deal gets done, and he can enjoy life.The only thing that's unfortunate is that it's a small business.",1
333," BYD \[Buffett’s recent Chinese investment\] seems like a speculative or venture capital investment, instead of a “value” investment.

334," BYD \[Buffett’s recent Chinese investment\] seems like a speculative or venture capital investment, instead of a “value” investment. Could Buffett explain?",All investments are “value” investments. What other kind can there be? You always expect to get more in the future for what you’re investing today. Deferred to Charlie. BYD is an interesting example because 5-10 yrs earlier BRK would not have made the investment. The old men are continuing to learn. Berkshire would have lower potential if we had stayed the way we were. I wasn’t sure I could get Warren to do this. Dave Sokol was inveigled to go to China and the both of us helped the Chairman with the ‘learning’ process.,1
335, Why did you invest in Harley-Davidson?,"I like the 15%. I measured that 15% against other credits and it looked attractive on both a relative basis and an absolute basis. Also, we have to have a certain amount of the portfolio go to debt. Lately, the government has become the guarantor for some companies but not for others and the “haves” and “have-nots” determined by certainty of government assistance rather than the credit quality. These finance companies have a problem getting funded, not with their customers. Any company where you can get your customers to tattoo your name on their body has quite a strong brand. For this investment I had to think what is the probability that they will not pay me back and would I want to own the company if they did not, basically that the equity isn’t worth zero. Risk premiums in the corporate bond market went from real low to real high. Right now, they’re out of whack. The flip side is that governments are overpriced. We have a bubble in governments. T-bills actually had a negative interest rate. I never thought I’d see that. A mattress is a better investment than the US 10 Year. Buying corporates and shorting the 10-year is a great idea and smart guys went broke doing it because even if you’re right, you need to be able to play out your hand. I always think about what I would do if a nuclear bomb went off or if Bernanke ran off with Paris Hilton to South America.",1
336, Opinion of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac? (2001),"In 2000, Berkshire Hathaway sold its large, long-term holding in Freddie Mac. ""We felt uncomfortable with certain aspects of the business as they developed, though they may not hurt the company. We did not sell because we were worried about more governmental regulation -- the opposite if anything. We felt the risk profile had changed.""Munger added, ""Maybe it's unique to us, but we're quite sensitive to financial risks.""Buffett continued, ""There are many things you don't know by looking at a financial company's financial statements. We've seen enough to be wary. We can't be 100% sure that we like what's going on. With some types of companies, you can spot problems early, but you spot troubles in financial institutions late."". ""Financial institutions make us nervous when they're trying to do well."" Think about that one for a while.At another point in the meeting, after a question about the underwriting risks in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio, Buffett said, ""the biggest risks are assumed by those who write lots of homeowner's policies. If you're Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae, guaranteeing mortgages for millions of people, what happens if an earthquake hits California? They're taking on enormous risk. I don't know if Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are demanding that all homes with mortgages they guarantee have earthquake insurance."" That's Buffett's polite way of saying they don't.",1

338," Opinion on Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Other Highly Leveraged Financial Institutions? (2003)","I have a lot of respect for Frank Raines the CEO of Fannie Mae. I think he's done a good job at Fannie Mae. The problem with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the S&Ls in the past -- they have a terrible problem of matching assets and liabilities. The problem is the optionality of mortgage interest. You have a 30-year instrument e.g., a fixed-rate home mortgage if you the homeowner have a good deal and a 30-minute deal if it's a bad one e.g., interest rates fall further. The public has been educated and will refinance. It's a big problem when you are operating on borrowed money in a very big way. If you run an institution that is highly leveraged, you'll look for one way or another to try to match liabilities as close as you can with the duration of assets. And you try to deal with the optionality of your counterparty. It's not easy to do. Fannie and Freddie try to mitigate this risk through various ways, and do a good job -- probably better than we could. But it's not perfect. I'd try to reduce this optionality and would be careful of counterparty risk.The things that really destroy people are 5- or 6-sigma events -- things that really aren't supposed to happen. Financial markets don't do every well at modeling this. It works until it doesn't. There are more theoretical 6-sigma events than any theory of probabilities will come up with. When you have gaps, markets close, etc., this is what causes companies to go out of business. Derivatives increase the chance of this happening and magnify the damage if it does.If anyone uses precise figures in finance, be careful.When Long-Term Capital Management had trouble with one type of asset, they had troubles with other types of assets -- and everyone else did too. The Fed stepped in -- something they never dreamed they would have to do -- because it threatened stability of the US financial system.I'll bet Fannie and Freddie are handling this better than their counterparties, such as the financial guarantors.The best thing you can do is count on your own resources. That's what we do at Berkshire. Charlie and I are rich enough that we don't need to stay up at night.---------------------------------------------------The GSEs were a very logical development. For a fee, which used to average 25 basis points, they would allow someone 3,000 miles away to buy a mortgage or portfolio of mortgages and not worry. The GSEs were looked at as government guaranteed, so investors didn’t worry.They became all about leverage – they could access capital at a low rate and built a huge carry trade borrow at low short-term rates and lend at higher long-term rates. Then they got carried away when they promised high rates of steady growth. It was madness – you can’t do that. If you lend for 30 years to someone who can repay in 30 seconds, as a practical matter you can’t perfectly handle that risk. So, they first enlarged their portfolios and then engaged in financial shenanigans.It boggles the mind how, with good auditors and board members, they misrepresented billions of dollars. They now have $1.5 trillion of mortgages and the Federal government is on the hook – markets believe it and it is – because two companies wanted earnings per share to go up. They acted like the two largest hedge funds in history.People are now seeing the consequences of the government issuing a guarantee. Congress should be paying a lot of attention to this. You can’t shut them down, but you can increase capital requirements and capital ratios. You could put them into run-off mode. There are plenty of other mortgage guarantee providers. It would not be the end of the world at all if the GSEs were put into run-off mode.If you can have a $5 billion mismark in one direction and a $9 billion mismark in the other direction as was the case with Freddie and Fannie, respectively, I would say we’ve come a long way from Jimmy Stewart in “It’s a Wonderful Life”.",1
339, How did you decide to invest in Salomon?,"Salomon like I said, I went into that because it was a 9% security in 1987 in September 1987 and the Dow was up 35% and we sold a lot of stuff. And I had a lot of money around and it looked to me like we would never get to do anything, so I took an attractive security form in a business I would never buy the common stock of. I went in because of that and I think generally it is a mistake. It worked out OK finally on that. But it is not what I should have been doing. I either should have waited in which case I could have bought more Coca-Cola a year later or thereabouts or I should have even bought Coke at the prices it was selling at even though it was selling at a pretty good price at the time. So that was a mistake.On Long-Term Capital that is—we have owned other businesses associated with securities over the years-–One of them is arbitrage. I’ve done arbitrage for 45 years and Graham did it for 30 years before that. That is a business unfortunately I have to be near a phone for. I have to really run it (arbitrage operations) out of the office myself, because it requires being more market-attuned because I don’t want to do that anymore. So unless a really big arbitrage situation came along that I understood, I won’t be doing much of that. But I’ve probably participated in about 300 arbitrage situations at least in my life maybe more. It was a good business, a perfectly good business.LTCM has a bunch of positions, they have tons of positions, but the top ten are probably 90% of the money that is at risk, and I know something about those ten positions. I don’t know everything about them by a long shot, but I know enough that I would feel OK at a big discount going in and we had the staying power to hold it out. We might lose money on something on that, but the odds are with us. That is a game that I understand. There are few other positions we have that are not that big because they can’t get that big. But they could involve yield curve relationships or on the run/off the run governments that are just things you learn over time being around securities markets. They are not the base of our business. Probably on average, they have accounted for 1⁄2 - 3⁄4 a percentage point of our return a year. They are little pluses you get for actually having been around a long time.One of the first arbitrages I did involved a company that offered cocoa beans in exchange for their stock. That was in 1955. I bought the stock, turned in the stock, got warehouse certificates for cocoa beans and they happen to be a different type but there was a basis differential and I sold them. That was something I was around at the time, so I learned about it. There hasn’t been a cocoa deal since. 40 odd years, I have been waiting for a cocoa deal. I haven’t seen it. It is there in my memory if it ever comes along. LTCM is that on a big scale.",1
340, Is it true that Salomon almost caused a global financial crisis?,"It could have been absolute chaos. There’s a very interesting story, with an interesting moral. Nick Brady was Treasury Secretary at the time. He was a Berkshire shareholder because of his long relationship with the Chaces.From Buffett’s 1991 annual letter: “Malcolm G. Chace, Jr., now 88, has decided not to stand for election as a director this year. But the association of the Chace family with Berkshire will not end: Malcolm III (Kim), Malcolm’s son, will be nominated to replace him. In 1931, Malcolm went to work for Berkshire Fine Spinning Associates, which merged with Hathaway Manufacturing Co. in 1955 to form our present company. Two years later, Malcolm became Berkshire Hathaway’s Chairman, a position he held as well in early 1965 when he made it possible for Buffett Partnership, Ltd. to buy a key block of Berkshire stock owned by some of his relatives. This purchase gave our partnership effective control of the company. Malcolm’s immediate family meanwhile kept its Berkshire stock and for the last 27 years has had the second- largest holding in the company, trailing only the Buffett family. Malcolm has been a joy to work with and we are delighted that the long-running relationship between the Chace family and Berkshire is continuing to a new generation.”.

341, Is it true that Salomon almost caused a global financial crisis?,"It’s hard to tell what will cause a crisis: who will yell fire, how many people will rush to the exits, etc.Look at Long-Term Capital Management, or what happened to the junk-bond market in 2002. It almost closed. It was chaos.In mid-August 1991, when we were at Salomon, on a Sunday we were within half an hour of seeking out a Federal judge and handing over the keys and filing for bankruptcy. The lawyers were drafting the bankruptcy documents. Fortunately, the Treasury ruling that would have forced Salomon to seek bankruptcy protection was reversed.But what would have happened if we’d filed? Coincidentally, Gorbachev was spirited away the same day Monday, August 19 and the Dow was down a few hundred points. What would have happened when the markets opened in Japan if Salomon Japan couldn’t deliver securities, etc.? Plus, Salomon had a $600-700 billion derivative book. Kim Chace, who I introduced you to earlier at the beginning of the meeting, Buffett introduced all of Berkshire’s directors, his father introduced me to Nick Brady when I was in my 30s. In 1991, he was head of the Treasury and they had issued a death sentence to us Salomon that morning. Fortunately Nick reversed it. Had he not, we would have filed for bankruptcy and it would have been a case study for a daisy-chain type of panic.That was nothing compared to what would happen now. It’s not an experiment that you would want to voluntarily conduct, let’s put it that way. Nervous laughter",1
342," You were rumored to be one of the rescue buyers of Long Term Capital, what was the play there, what did you see?","The Fortune Magazine that has Rupert Murdoch on the cover. It tells the whole story of our involvement; it is kind of an interesting story. I got the really serious call about LTCM on a Friday afternoon that things were getting serious. I know those people most of them pretty well--most of them at Salomon when I was there. And the place was imploding and the FED was sending people up that weekend. Between that Friday and the following Wed. when the NY Fed, in effect, orchestrated a rescue effort but without any Federal money involved. I was quite active but I was having a terrible time reaching anybody.We put in a bid on Wednesday morning. I talked to Bill McDonough at the NY Fed. We made a bid for 250 million for the net assets but we would have put in 3 and 3/4 billion on top of that. $3 billion from Berkshire, $700 mil. from AIG and $300 million. from Goldman Sachs. And we submitted that but we put a very short time limit on that because when you are bidding on 100 billion worth of securities that are moving around, you don't want to leave a fixed price bid out there for very long.In the end the bankers made the deal, but it was an interesting period. The whole LTCM is really fascinating because if you take Larry Hillenbrand, Eric Rosenfeld, John Meriwether and the two Nobel prize winners. If you take the 16 of them, they have about as high an IQ as any 16 people working together in one business in the country, including Microsoft. An incredible amount of intellect in one room. Now you combine that with the fact that those people had extensive experience in the field they were operating in. These were not a bunch of guys who had made their money selling men’s clothing and all of a sudden went into the securities business. They had in aggregate, the 16, had 300 or 400 years of experience doing exactly what they were doing and then you throw in the third factor that most of them had most of their very substantial net worth’s in the businesses. Hundreds and hundreds of millions of their own money up (at risk), super high intellect and working in a field that they knew. Essentially they went broke. That to me is absolutely fascinating.If I ever write a book it will be called, Why Smart People Do Dumb Things. My partner says it should be autobiographical. But this might be an interesting illustration. They are perfectly decent guys. I respect them and they helped me out when I had problems at Salomon. They are not bad people at all.But to make money they didn’t have and didn’t need, they risked what they did have and what they did need. That is just plain foolish; it doesn’t matter what your IQ is. If you risk something that is important to you for something that is unimportant to you it just doesn’t make sense. I don’t care if the odds you succeed are 99 to 1 or 1000 to 1 that you succeed. If you hand me a gun with a million chambers with one bullet in a chamber and put it up to your temple and I am paid to pull the trigger, it doesn’t matter how much I would be paid. I would not pull the trigger. You can name any sum you want, but it doesn’t do anything for me on the upside and I think the downside is fairly clear. Yet people do it financially very much without thinking.There was a lousy book with a great title written by Walter Gutman—You Only Have to Get Rich Once. Now that seems pretty fundamental. If you have $100 million at the beginning of the year and you will make 10% if you are unleveraged and 20% if you are leveraged 99 times out of a 100, what difference if at the end of the year, you have $110 million or $120 million? It makes no difference. If you die at the end of the year, the guy who makes up the story may make a typo, he may have said 110 even though you had a 120. You have gained nothing at all. It makes absolutely no difference. It makes nodifference to your family or anybody else.The downside, especially if you are managing other people’s money, is not only losing all your money, but it is disgrace, humiliation and facing friends whose money you have lost. Yet 16 guys with very high IQs entered into that game. I think it is madness. It is produced by an over reliance to some extent on things. Those guys would tell me back at Salomon; a six Sigma event wouldn’t touch us. But they were wrong. History does not tell you of future things happening. They had a great reliance on mathematics. They thought that the Beta of the stock told you something about the risk of the stock. It doesn’t tell you a damn thing about the risk of the stock in my view.Sigma’s do not tell you about the risk of going broke in my view and maybe now in their view too. But I don’t like to use them as an example. The same thing in a different way could happen to any of us, where we really have a blind spot about something that is crucial, because we know a whole lot of something else. It is like Henry Kauffman said, “The ones who are going broke in this situation are of two types, the ones who know nothing and the ones who know everything.” It is sad in a way.I urge you. We basically never borrow money. I never borrowed money even when I had $10,000 basically, what difference did it make. I was having fun as I went along it didn’t matter whether I had $10,000 or $100,000 or $1,000,000 unless I had a medical emergency come along.I was going to do the same things when I had a little bit of money as when I had a lot of money. If you think of the difference between me and you, we wear the same clothes basically (SunTrust gives me mine), we eat similar food—we all go to McDonald’s or better yet, Dairy Queen, and we live in a house that is warm in winter and cool in summer. We watch the Nebraska (football) game on big screen TV. You see it the same way I see it. We do everything the same—our lives are not that different. The only thing we do is we travel differently. What can I do that you can’t do?I get to work in a job that I love, but I have always worked at a job that I loved. I loved it just as much when I thought it was a big deal to make $1,000. I urge you to work in jobs that you love. I think you are out of your mind if you keep taking jobs that you don’t like because you think it will look good on your resume. I was with a fellow at Harvard the other day who was taking me over to talk. He was 28 and he was telling me all that he had done in life, which was terrific. And then I said, “What will you do next?” “Well,” he said, “Maybe after I get my MBA I will go to work for a consulting firm because it will look good on my resume.” I said, “Look, you are 28 and you have been doing all these things, you have a resume 10 times than anybody I have ever seen. Isn’t that a little like saving up sex for your old age?There comes a time when you ought to start doing what you want. Take a job that you love. You will jump out of bed in the morning. When I first got out of Columbia Business School, I wanted to go to work for Graham immediately for nothing. He thought I was over-priced. But I kept pestering him. I sold securities for three years and I kept writing him and finally I went to work for him for a couple of years. It was a great experience. But I always worked in a job that I loved doing. You really should take a job that if you were independently wealthy that would be the job you would take. You will learn something, you will be excited about, and you will jump out of bed. You can’t miss. You may try something else later on, but you will get way more out of it and I don’t care what the starting salary is.When you get out of here take a job you love, not a job you think will look good on your resume. You ought to find something you like.If you think you will be happier getting 2x instead of 1x, you are probably making a mistake. You will get in trouble if you think making 10x or 20x will make you happier because then you will borrow money when you shouldn’t or cut corners on things. It just doesn’t make sense and you won’t like it when you look back.",1
343," I cannot buy See’s Candies in Bonn Germany. See’s Candies vs. Lindt. Sees’ has a 20% profit margin; their growth is okay. Lindt does 14%, but is now global. Which is better, high profits with low growth, or high growth with lower profits?","It doesn’t make any difference. We want a company with a durable advantage, which we can understand, a management we can trust, at a good price. We’ve looked at every confectionary business. We can sometimes take action. If you have a good private business, the best thing to do is to keep it. No reason to sell it. If you don’t need the billion, then it’s just a farm. We never urge people to sell good businesses, but if they do need to sell, they can keep more of the attributes they love by selling to Berkshire. We are a larger buyer. Most people shouldn’t sell us their business, but we want them to think of us if they do decide to sell. We want to be on the radar screen. We are going to get more on the radar screen in Europe. There is a price at which we would buy stock in Lindt, but it is unlikely to sell there. Many CEOs want to sell to me, but there are thousands of businesses in the world. We should buy the most attractive amongst the ones we understand and like. Stocks give you bargains, but individual owners won’t. But we will do it at a fair price. We aren’t going to look for a given confectionary company. We don’t do anything when the phrase ‘regardless of price’ enters the equation.

I was terribly wrong in thinking it was the Gen Re of 15 years earlier. Gen Re now is the company I thought it was in 1998 when I bought it. It wasn’t an easy job. Post mortems are evaluating our handiwork. Acquisitions are our choices— not another department or a consultant. We made some really dumb decisions. Joe’s the hero.",1

Do you regard GE and Goldman as attractive businesses or attractive securities?,"A very substantial fraction of American businesses over the last 15 years have managed earnings. We felt good about the quality of the businesses and the quality of the managements, but it was primarily the terms of the GE and Goldman deals that made them attractive. There were no second sources to GE and Goldman. I know the GE and Goldman CEOs quite well and am very happy with the deals. We’ve done a lot of business with Goldman over the years. We’ve bought I don’t know how many wind turbines from GE.",1
348, Swiss Re - I'd like to know about its float and risks. How can you be comfortable with the situation?,"We have several arrangements with Swiss Re. We invested three billion Swiss francs $2.6 billion in Swiss Re, and it pays us 12%. This is not a junior security. Their problems are not due to their insurance underwriting. They develop a large amount of float relative to premiums. Swiss Re’s problems were a little akin to AIG’s. If Swiss Re’s a problem, we should have more like that.Comment: They say a stressful situation that doesn’t kill you, makes you stronger. Somewhat similarly, a company’s problems that prove not to be fatal can make its investment case stronger—at a sufficiently low price. Obviously, Buffett didn’t view Swiss Re’s problems as being a lot like AIG’s.",1
349," Goldman Sachs - Every year you use clip from Solomon Crisis where you warned Solomon’s employees that you will be ruthless if reputation if the firm stained. Clearly GS has lost reputation. What is your reaction to the lawsuit, its affect on your GS investment, and what advice you have now for GS based on your experience at Solomon?","My attitude is simple. This was a 3:2 decision by SEC commissioners where they usually decide unanimously. I would have voted with the minority. ACA was a bond insurer, not an investor, pure and simple.

Ironically, this whole situation has helped BRK’s investment in GS. BRK got $5B in preferred stock (that pays $500M per year) that GS has the right to call at 110% of par and get rid of the preferred that costs them so much each year. BRK would have to put that money in ST securities if they got it back and every day that GS does not call the stock is money in the bank for BRK. In fact, it amounts to $15 per second.

350," Goldman Sachs - Every year you use clip from Solomon Crisis where you warned Solomon’s employees that you will be ruthless if reputation if the firm stained. Clearly GS has lost reputation. What is your reaction to the lawsuit, its affect on your GS investment, and what advice you have now for GS based on your experience at Solomon?","Abacus was made subject of SEC complaint (22pages) and I think there has been misreporting on the nature of the transaction. I would like to clarify this transaction, as it is important and frequently mischaracterized. In the Abacus transaction, there were four losers. GS didn’t intend to lose but did, they couldn’t sell their piece. The main loser was a very large bank in Europe named ABN Amro. Why did they lose money? They guaranteed the credit of another company ACA. ABN was in the business of judging credits, deciding credit. They fronted the transaction, guaranteed it. We do it frequently here at Berkshire. Many in business will take a policy if we guarantee the policy. We’ve made a lot of money doing this over the years. We lost a fair amount doing this with some dishonest people in early 1970s. They were syndicates at Lloyds. In Abacus, ABN guaranteed $900m and was paid 17bps of insurance. They got $1.6m for $900m of insurance coverage. The company went broke, so they had to pay the $900m. The bank made a dumb credit deal. It is hard for me to be sympathetic for a bank that made a bad credit trade. ACA, and you wouldn’t know this from the reporting, but they were a bond insurer. They started in municipal bonds, like AMBAC, FSA, etc. Many of those companies started insuring municipal bonds some 30 yrs ago, and it was a big business. But the profits were squeezed. They found new places to insure – and got into insuring structured credits. I described it a few years ago in the annual report like Mae West, “I was Snow White but I drifted”. Almost all of them did it – they didn’t understand it well, but made more money. Then they all got into trouble. Is there anything wrong with insuring structured credits? No, but you better know what you are doing. We went into municipal bond business when others got into trouble, we got paid more, and we stayed away from CDOs or RMBS. These deals were too hard. We did insure something. It will help you understand Abacus. This deal slide up on screen of portfolio of US state bonds we did insure. A large investment bank came to us. We insure a local power generation company, and the Nebraska Methodist hospital. We have $100m with the hospital. An investment bank came to us, with this list of names of states -- $1.1b for Florida, $200m for California. Will you insure the bonds of these States that they will pay for the next ten years. I looked at list, and we had to decide a) do we know enough and b) what premium to charge. We insured $160m for 10yrs. On other side, someone is insured that we will pay if they don’t pay. We didn’t come up with list. There are four reasons we were showed this trade. Lehman might own it and simply want insurance, Lehman might be negative on it – and this is a method to short, they might have a customer wanting protection, or they might have a customer negative on it wanting to short. We don’t care why they wanted the insurance, it was our job to insure the bonds. If they told me Ben Bernanke was on other side of trade, it wouldn’t matter. If it matters to me, I shouldn’t take it. We did with the bonds what ACA did. With list of 120, ACA only accepted 50, then negotiated for 30 more. In Abacus it was a mutual negotiation. Unfortunately, all the bonds went south very quickly – it wasn’t clear this would happen in early 2007. If you look at how the ABX was trading, it wasn’t obvious. Now there can be trouble in these States bonds we have insured. Maybe the guy on other side knows more than me. But I see nothing, I won’t complain if I lose money. I can’t claim other side had superior knowledge. Central part of the SEC argument is that Paulson knew more about the transaction. In retrospect, it was just a dumb insurance decision. Charlie?. We insure about $140bn of muni bonds. We aren’t bigger because we think the premiums aren’t the right price. Some people when premiums are wrong get busier – do more. We don’t, we go golfing. We think much is wrong on Wall Street. But our experience with Goldman goes back 44 years. We’ve bought more businesses through them than anyone else. We trade with them as well. We don’t use them as investment advisors – we make our own decisions. When we trade, they could be selling or buying for their own account. They don’t owe us a rationale or reasoning, nor do we owe them. They are acting in a non-fiduciary capacity when they are trading with us. If working on a transaction or financing, that is different. We have had a lot of very satisfactory business with Goldman. The first bond issue we did was 1967, on slide 2, an offering of Diversified Retailing Corp, $5,500,000. We were imaginative calling it diversified even though we only owned one business. NY Securities and Nebraska Securities were the underwriters. Usually the lead underwriter was at the top. We were having trouble raising the $5.5m. I called Gus Levy and Al Gordon at Kidder Peabody. No one wanted to give us the money. Both Gus Levy and AL Gordon said we’ll take a big piece. GS and Kidder were next largest underwriters, they asked us to leave their names off the tombstone. But they did come through for us, under an assumed name. Al Gordon died last year at 107, worked until 104. Gus Levy was a remarkable man.",1

I have been on board of at least of one well known company when they got a Wells Notice and they didn’t publicize it, and it was nothing. If you regard it as material, you report it.

353, BNSF deal. You have discussed the certainty of allowable returns in the industry. How are these calculated?,"The authorities (the Service Transportation Board) have adopted a 10.5% ROIC as the agreed upon amount. Of course this could be adjusted if there was a huge change in interest rates. Utilities often get 12% ROE. Railroads go to returns on invested capital. I don't think this is a crazy standard. Railroads, unlike the electric utilities where you are guaranteed a rate of return, are more volatile due to the risk of large economic contractions. If you behave yourself in electric utility, you will almost always make your returns. Railroads have more up and down, more downside. In general, you want railroads investing a lot more than depreciation to improve the transportation system. 10.5% is inducement enough. CThe country as a whole and the railroad systems have a common interest in not earning a huge profit but generating a fair return that allows for continued investment. If Service Transportation Board says 10.5%, that is not a crazy number. Railroads have been regulated successfully. They have been totally rebuilt over the last 30-40 years through improved tracks, bridges - the average train is twice as long and twice as heavy. By and large a system of wise regulation and wise management allowed this. That was not always the case. The existing system has worked very well for all of us.",1

355, Moody’s had potential conflicts of interest. Why do you retain Moody’s in Berkshire’s portfolio? Why didn’t you use your influence to address Moody’s perceived problems?,"I don’t think conflicts of interest were the biggest causes of the ratings agencies’ problems. Five years ago, virtually everyone thought home prices couldn’t go down. Home prices always go up it was widely believed. There was an almost total belief that house prices would rise. They the ratings agencies, investors, etc. just didn’t understand the various things that can happen in a bubble with $20 trillion in total assets. People leveraged up their biggest asset enormously. As it began to melt down, it became self-reinforcing. They the ratings agencies would have been criticized if they’d bucked prevailing wisdom. Taking a different view 4 – 5 years ago might have led to Congressional committees asking how they could be so un- American as to take such a dim view of American homeowners. Ratings agencies and the American people made terrible mistakes. So did Congress and regulators. I never made a call to Moody’s regarding their procedures. When we own stock, we don’t own them companies to change them. We’ve had very little luck when we’ve tried to change companies. Ratings agencies are still a good business. It’s a business with few people companies in it, it doesn’t require capital, and it has the fundamentals of a good business. They won’t be doing the previous volume in capital markets for awhile. Charlie and I pay no attention to ratings. We don’t outsource credit analysis. The people who stirred up the Kool-Aid drank it. It was stupidity, and everyone else was doing it. I send out letters to managers every couple of years: If you’re doing something because everyone else is, that’s the wrong reason. That’s not an acceptable excuse at Berkshire.

Moody’ s stake is being sold, has the investment case changed?. We won’t discuss what we will or won’t do with our securities. Agencies have a wonderful business. Good pricing power, no capital required. People will need ratings agencies. They succumbed to same mania that infected everyone – it is hard to think contrary to the crowd. They couldn’t see a world where residential housing countrywide could collapse. Incentive may have been bad, but also it is just difficult to think contrary to the crowd. If structure doesn’t change, it is a pretty darn good business. You can’t shop pricing. We however have never paid any attention to ratings. If we can’t do it ourselves, we don’t do it. If model doesn’t change, it’s a good business. Ratings agencies in present form and present incentives have been a wonderful influence for many decades. Cognition faltered, and drifted with stupidity of the times. Part of it was asininity of American business education, their over-belief in models. I haven’t heard a single apology for their huge contribution to our present difficulties.",1

Is there a potential risk of loss of intrinsic value of these companies due to the current health concerns?  ","I have been living on these products for 70 years. It depends on how you feel about sugar. 20% of Americans consume something with sugar in it every day. The life span of Americans has increased. There is no worry of product liability but this is always a fertile field for plaintiffs. Berkshire Hathaway has passed on some opportunities because of the concern of product liability.   Decisions are usually made with a pessimistic attitude and it is projected that the trend will continue to accelerate.back to the questions.(https://buffettfaq.com/#questions). I couldn’t have been more wrong about the Irish banks. The $9.00 price isn’t the issue, it’s the business model. Nobody lied to me. It was a terrible mistake by me. I just plain wasn’t paying attention and should have known about their land development loans. Wells Fargo, among the largest banks, has the best competitive position. Regarding WaMu Washington Mutual, there were a lot of signs of possible trouble if the model of ever-rising housing prices was wrong. They were doing things they shouldn’t be doing with leverage. If you read the SEC Form 10-Ks and 10-Qs, you could spot the difference. There’s no comparison between Wells Fargo versus WaMu. Banking has real differences, but people don’t look at them carefully. Think of a copper producer with costs at $2.50/pound versus another with costs of $1.00/pound. One’s done if prices drop to $1.50/pound, and the other is fine. Wells’ $600 million amortization of acquired deposits is not a real cost—yet nobody notices. I think it was pretty clear regarding Freddie and Fannie. We got calls from investment bankers looking for interest in them. One look and we could see they were in big, big trouble. People who don’t spend a lot of time investing can’t differentiate financial institutions. It’s easier with Coke or a utility. You have to know something about banking. Gen Re’s derivatives division cost us $400+ million to get out of. It was a black box to produce all sorts of numbers. It’s hard for a passive investor to discern. A lot of new regulation wouldn’t have been needed if accounting had done a better job. If accountants don’t have shame, they’re not thinking right.",1

And Warren, do you agree with Charlie?","Mid-September was as close to a total financial meltdown as there could be. There was a commercial paper freeze-up, and $100 billion was taken out of money market funds. It required prompt action. We were looking into the abyss. I commend the actions taken, especially since they government officials were working 20 hours a day. Merrill Lynch would have gone if Bank of America didn’t buy it. I sympathize with Dick Kovacevich’s “asinine” comment. He was called on a Sunday and told to be in Washington D.C. the next day, without knowing why. He was told they Wells Fargo would take it TARP funds, and he had an hour to sign. That’s the nature of an emergency. By and large, the authorities did a good job. Among the large banks, Wells is a wonderful bank and has some advantages that other banks don’t. I recommend JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon’s shareholder letter; it’s on JP Morgan’s website. Jamie did a great job. It’s as good a shareholder letter as I’ve seen. It’s a long letter, but worth reading. He did a great job writing about the crisis.",1
360, What are the economic characteristics that make Kraft a good business?,"Most big food businesses are good businesses in that they earn good returns on tangible assets. If you own important branded assets in this country, and you have good assets, it is not easy to take on those products. Just imagine Coca-Cola. They sell 1.5 billion servings every day. It has been in everyone’s mind since 1886—associated with good value, happiness and refreshment. It is virtually impossible to take it on in a huge way. It may not be the same with Kraft. Kool-Aid, but I’m not sure I want to take on Kool-Aid. To implant RC Cola in people’s minds globally is very, very difficult. A brand is a promise. Coca-Cola delivers something to you. Virgin Cola — an unusual promise in a product—tried and couldn’t figure it out. Whatever it was, it didn’t work. Don Keough would know. Who would buy a can for two-cents-a-can less than Coca-Cola? We feel pretty good about branded products if they’re leaders in their field. There is nothing unusual about Kraft that’s different from Kellogg. Some good factors are price. If you don’t pay too much, you will do okay. But you won’t get superrich, as the attributes of a strong brand are well recognized.",1

362," Kraft, how would you grade Kraft board and compensation. CEO’s $23m?","I didn’t like the Cadbury or pizza deals. We’ve made our share of dumb deals at Berkshire. But even though the odds are that is dumb -- doesn’t mean it will be dumb. We get mad when other people do dumb things with our money. Sold $3.7b pizza business, and the other guy paid that, but Kraft received $2.4b net of tax. Pizza was earning $280m pretax in prior year. In 2009 it earned $340m pretax for sales that were growing faster. They didn’t get a great price. Cadbury is growing slowly. Karft quoted last year’s earnings for pizza and next year’s earnings for Cadbury. Giving up $340m pretax with sales growing faster than Cadbury was particularly dumb when Kraft had already shown they understood how to do an efficient deal like Post Cereals. I don’t do that speak up too often, but we owned a lot of it. I wanted to stick with pizza and skip Cadbury. Present price for Kraft is still well below the price the constituent pieces like Koolaid, Jello, and Oscar Meyer brands would sell for independently, particularly if valued the way Kraft valued Cadbury. I didn’t like them paying so much to buy Cadbury. In terms of compensation, we have a system which is rational. Many companies have different compensation systems. laughter.

366, To what extent should preferred shareholders and debt holders of GM and Chrysler should be exposed to losses in the restructurings of those companies?,"It’s institution specific. There’s no reason for senior debt to give up anything, if there’s lots of equity and earnings power. Wells Fargo and US Bank are making lots of money, and earning power is intact. There’s lots of equity beneath the preferreds. It’s like a 70% LTV loan-to-value homeowner shouldn’t necessarily lose because a 95%+ LTV homeowner is losing. I would love to buy all of US Bank or Wells Fargo. We can’t, because it would make us a bank holding company. GM and Chrysler are very different. They’re losing money, and there’s no common equity. If equity is wiped out, then you have to decide who gets losses. Wells Fargo and US bank are very different. I have nothing to add.",1

Eddie is a very smart guy but putting Kmart and Sears together is a tough hand. Turning around a retailer that has been slipping for a long time would be very difficult. Can you think of an example of a retailer that was successfully turned around? Broadcasting is easy; retailing is the other extreme. If you had a network television station 50 years ago, you didn't really have to invent or being a good salesman. The network paid you; car dealers paid you, and you made money.But in retail you have to be smarter than Wal-Mart. Every day retailers are constantly thinking about ways to get ahead of what they were doing the previous day.Retailing is like shooting at a moving target. In the past, people didn't like to go excessive distances from the street cars to buy things. People would flock to those retailers that were near by. In 1996 we bought the Hochschild Kohn department store in Baltimore. We learned quickly that it wasn't going to be a winner, long-term, in a very short period of time. We had an antiquated distribution system. We did everything else right. We put in escalators. We gave people more credit. We had a great guy running it, and we still couldn't win. So we sold it around 1970. That store isn't there anymore. It isn't good enough that there were smart people running it.It will be interesting to see how Kmart and Sears play out. They already have a lot of real estate, and have let go of a bunch of Sears' management (500 people). They've captured some savings already.We would rather look for easier things to do. The Buffett grocery stores started in Omaha in 1869 and lasted for 100 years. There were two competitors. In 1950, one competitor went out of business. In 1960 the other closed. We had the whole town to ourselves and still didn't make any money.How many retailers have really sunk, and then come back? Not many. I can't think of any. Don't bet against the best. Costco is working on a 10-11% gross margin that is better than the Wal-Mart's and Sams'. In comparison, department stores have 35% gross margins. It's tough to compete against the best deal for customers. Department stores will keep their old customers that have a habit of shopping there, but they won't pick up new ones. Wal-Mart is also a tough competitor because others can't compete at their margins. It's very efficient.If Eddie sees it as impossible, he won't watch it evaporate. Maybe he can combine certain things and increase efficiencies, but he won't be able to compete against Costco's margins.",1

371, What is the intrinsic value of Berkshire? Can you use book value as a guide to company valuations?,"Really wonderful businesses need no book value. Book value is not a great proxy for intrinsic value and it is not a substitute. Berkshire was not worth book value in 1965, intrinsic value was below book value, now the business is worth a great deal more than book value. Book value is not a bad starting point for Berkshire when trying to calculate intrinsic value. We generally do not look at book value when evaluating a stock.---------------------------------------------------Re: How would Warren value Berkshire?I’d think about what’s there, what are they trying to do, what’s it worth if they don’t succeed in deploying additional capital, and what it’s worth if they do. What are the resources available to keep adding to the collection of businesses? I think you’ll find the information in the annual report that you need to evaluate Berkshire. Don’t take it out to 4 decimal places. If Charlie and I had to write down a number, it would be different but in the same ballpark.What Berkshire will be worth 10 years from now will depend on earnings, the quality of those earnings and the liquid assets we have. We keep working on it, but we’re so big. There’s no way in the world we can replicate the past, but hopefully we do a reasonable job.I don’t think we’ll hit any home runs under any circumstances.A normal level of cash for Berkshire might be about $10 billion. Because of the catastrophe-insurance business we’re in, we don’t scrape the bottom of the barrel in terms of cash reserves. We might temporarily dip below $10 billion – about one year’s worth of earnings, incidentally – but we don’t need anything like $40 billion. We’d be much happier if we had the excess invested in things we love.I think, according to the 10-Q, we have $37 billion in cash $37.675 billion, to be precise, not counting the finance businesses, and we spent $4 billion on Iscar and we’re spending on some other things.We’d like very much to spend down to $10 billion and we spend all of our time on this. We have one idea at present that could take up to $15 billion of cash, but it’s a low probability. We’ll get more choices in the utility area.While we don’t like having excess cash, we like doing dumb deals even less because we’re stuck with them forever. You’re right that we should be uncomfortable that we have this cash, but the alternative of doing bad deals is far worse.I think it’s likely, but far from certain, that three years from now we will have significantly less cash and hopefully far more earnings power. We love having $4 billion in Iscar rather than it sitting around in short-term bonds. You’re right to keep jabbing us, but we jab ourselves. Neither one of us likes having cash.We’re the biggest player in the world in catastrophe insurance, and people come to us because we’re so liquid, but we don’t need so much cash.We spent $3.5 billion at the Berkshire level in PacifiCorp. Come back next year and I hope we have less cash.---------------------------------------------------Intrinsic value is simply the sum of all future cash flows a business generates between now and judgment day, discounted back at the proper rate. But that’s pretty nebulous. To value the businesses we own presently, we try to give you information to make a reasonable judgment about that. We own securities, which are easy to value, and operating businesses. We try to give you the information we use to value them.Since Berkshire retains all of its earnings, it becomes very important to evaluate what we’ll do with earnings over time.If you’d looked at the intrinsic value of Berkshire in 1965, we had a textile business worth $12 per share, but that wasn’t all. You had to evaluate not only the business, but also the skill with which retained earnings would be used.It’s the same situation today: we will put to work billions of dollars this year and in the future. If we do this effectively, each dollar has a value of more than $1. We have $80,000 per share in marketable securities. If our insurance business breaks even, that’s free to us. We’re trying to add to our collection of operating businesses and they’ll add to earnings.If Charlie and I wrote down our estimates of Berkshire’s intrinsic value, they wouldn’t be exactly the same, but they would be close.---------------------------------------------------Q - what do you think about the market’s valuation of Berkshire shares? The stock price is off more than the decline in Berkshire’s operations.. You put your finger on something. We think our investments are worth more than they’re carried for. If you leave out insurance earnings from underwriting, last year and this, earnings power was below normal. We have good businesses overall. A few have problems, but many will do fabulously well. It’s okay to look at Berkshire as two parts: securities, and non-underwriting earnings power. We hope both will increase over time. Berkshire is cheaper in relation to intrinsic value at the end of 2008 than 2007. That’s true of most companies. Our focus is for operating earnings to rise. Everything is affected by everything else in the financial world. The insurance business is a remarkable business. In the September 2008 meltdown, people started behaving differently, like a bell had been rung. It hurt jewelry, carpet, NetJets. But the phones started ringing at GEICO. Thousands more came to the website to save money. Saving $100 became important. We added 665,000 policyholders in 2008, and we added 505,000 in just January through April 2009. GEICO is the low-cost producer of auto insurance. It builds a lot of value over time. We had 2 – 5% market share when Tony Nicely took over; 8% now. We’re the third largest auto insurer in the country, and the fundamentals are in place to take that higher.",1

But every year don't measure it by the earnings in the quarter that year. Measure it by whether the moat around that business, what gives it competitive advantage over time has widened or narrowed. If you keep doing that for 100 years, it's going to work out very well. Then I tell them basically if the reason for doing something is everybody else is doing it, it's not good enough.

375, What is your fondest hope for Berkshire?,"I hope for two things: decent performance, and that the culture is maintained. We are shareholder- and manager-oriented. We want to be the best home in the world for wonderful family businesses. I fully expect that what we have tried to build into Berkshire will live into the future far beyond my tenure as CEO. We have great candidates to succeed me and we have a Board and managers that have all seen what works. We have a very fine and strong culture. I am sure it will be continued, and that we will get good results. I hope in 20 years that fine businesses will immediately think that if they have to sell their business, they would sell it to Berkshire. We also want it to have the oldest living managers. laughter; standing ovation.",1
376, What can go wrong at Berkshire?,"We don’t worry about our businesses. We have a diverse group of good businesses with great managers. What we worry about is something going wrong. We have 180,000 employees, so it’s guaranteed that something will go wrong. We know it will happen. We just try to have – we do have – the right incentives in place.For example, when I get on a NetJets flight, even if I’m in a hurry, I don’t say to the pilot, “Hey, I’m in a hurry. Can you speed it up.” The last thing I want is a pilot rushing through his pre-flight checklist, etc.But companies do this all the time in the way they incentivise people. They should not have a system that encourages a focus on quarterly earnings. Our managers have no quarterly budgets – I don’t know what our numbers are going to be next quarter. I’m also careful not to communicate anything to the contrary via body language.Insurance companies in particular can report pretty much any numbers that they want. With $44 billion of reserves, it would be easy to adjust the reserves to show whatever profit was desired.Even if quarterly numbers weren’t tied to our managers’ compensation, if I went to Wall Street and promised X, the managers, who wouldn’t want to let me down, might play some games to achieve X.. What we don’t like in modern capitalism is the expectations game. It’s not the kissing cousin of evil; it’s the blood brother.People who predict precisely are either kidding themselves or others. We’ve seen people get their egos involved. And everyone in the organization knows what the CEO has promised in public. It’s setting up a system that sets up financial or psychological pressure for people to do things they probably don’t want to do. It’s a terrible mistake.",1

378, What is Berkshire's cost of capital?,"A corporation's cost of capital is 1/4 of 1% below the return on capital of any deal the CEO wants to do.I've listened to many cost of capital discussions and they've never made much sense.

379, You've targeted Berkshire Hathaway's book-value growth at 15%. You have come through at about 24%. That is a big gap of 9% between your modesty and the outcome.

380, You've targeted Berkshire Hathaway's book-value growth at 15%. You have come through at about 24%. That is a big gap of 9% between your modesty and the outcome. Why is there such a big gap?,"I don't think it was modesty. For one thing, we've had a terrific market that has reappraised all businesses in the last 10 or 15 years. So when we really started worrying about future performance, the key factor was having larger amounts of capital. There's no question that the larger the amount of capital, the harder the job is. We were fortunate that that ascension in capital happened to coincide with things that just lifted all the boats substantially. We have had better luck than I would have guessed we would have had 10 years ago. It's been aided by a huge tailwind, and absent that tailwind we wouldn't have done as well. We won't have that tailwind in the future, I can assure you of that, but we will have a larger amount of capital. If Charlie and I could make a deal to increase the intrinsic value of Berkshire by 15% a year over the next 10 years, we would sign up now. I don't want you to even tempt us with lower numbers. If we paid no dividend at all over a 10 year period, you can figure out where a 15% rate would take us. We hope to get there, but we think that is absolutely tops. When the market starts underperforming businesses, the rate could be very substantially lower than that.Be careful, Charlie, or we'll have a voice vote that we should move to Singapore. This is a group that wants performance. Large sums of money aren't going to compound at super rates. Anybody that manages large sums of money that promises or implies that they can achieve really outstanding returns--I'd stay away from them. The numbers just get too big. You've seen some of that with certain money management organizations in recent years. 15% on an intrinsic value which is substantially greater than our book value--it gets to be a very, very big number. We need huge ideas--we don't need thousands of ideas. I mean, we might need them, but we could never come up with them. What we look for is the very large idea. But we're not finding them now. We'll keep looking, and every now and then we will find something. If you think you have any chance of doing better than 15%--and believe me, that's not a number I would want to sign my name to--you're going to disappointed in Berkshire. We don't want to disappoint you, so that's the reason we try to be realistic about expectations.---------------------------------------------------I think (and Charlie does too) that Berkshire's value has grown significantly over past few years.Intrinsic value is the stream of cash from now until judgment day, discounted based on consideration of other uses. You have to understand what kinds of businesses you can make a reasonable assessment of. At Berkshire, you have two questions: 1) what its businesses are worth now, and 2) what we do with the capital. 35 years ago, people underestimated what we would do with the capital. But we're now in a whole different game, with lots more capital.Intrinsic value is a range.",1

382, Why don't more people copy Berkshire as an investment vehicle--a corporation that pays no dividend?,"There are other things to copy about Berkshire, but they don't get copied either. It was always interesting to me that everyone read Graham, and they didn't misread him, it's just that they didn't like following him. In terms of not paying dividends, we don't pay dividends because we think we can turn every dollar we make into more than a dollar in market value. The only reason for us to keep your money is to make it worth more by us keeping it than it would be worth if we gave it to you. That's the test, if we come to the conclusion that we can't do that, we should distribute it to you.The interesting thing is we have certain businesses, See's Candy being one, where we don't have a way to intelligently use all of the money that See's generates within See's candy company. So if See's were a stand-alone company, it would pay very large dividends, not because it had a dividend paying policy, but because it wouldn't have a way of using, in this case, $30 million a year in intelligently expanding that business. We hope that in the overall Berkshire Hathaway scheme of things, that we can intelligently use the money that the companies in aggregate generate for us and we think so far we have, and we think the prospects are reasonably good that we can continue to do that. But dividend policy should really be determined by that criteria, also keeping in mind the possibilities of repurchasing stock. If Coke had paid no dividends, and simply repurchased shares and developed the bottling system, the shareholders probably would have been even better off. They've been sensationally well as it is, but they probably would have been even better off than they have been with the dividend policy they have. And that's true for Gillette and Disney.",1
383, What would Berkshire be like if you hadn't met Charlie Munger?,"It would be very different, but I could say the same thing about a lot of other people, too. I've had a lot (at least a dozen) of heroes, including my parents. Charlie and I didn't meet until 1959, although he grew up a half a block from where I lived. Charlie was 35 and I was 29. We've been partners ever since. He is very strong-minded, but we've never had an argument that whole time. I've never been let down once. It must be a terrible feeling to be let down by a hero.Hang around people who are better than you all the time. You do pick up the behavior of people who are around you. It will make you a better person. Marry upward. That is the person who is going to have the biggest effect on you. A relationship like that over the decades will do nothing but good.",1
384, What happens when CEOs call you?,"I sit and wait for the phone to ring. I can give most answers in less than a minute. Deals? I like to hear price first.

Custom frame business can’t be replicated. Met Ponzio later for one hour and never saw him again.",1
385, How to evaluate Berkshire or MSFT if it does not pay dividends?,"It won’t pay any dividends either. That is a promise I can keep. All you get with Berkshire, you stick it in your safe deposit box and then every year you go down and fondle it. You take it out and then you put it back. There is enormous psychic reward in that. Don’t underestimate it.The real question is if we can retain dollar bills and turn them into more than a dollar at a decent rate. That is what we try to do. And Charlie Munger and I have all our money in it to do that. That is all we will get paid for doing. We won’t take any options or we won’t take any salaries to speak of. But that is what we are trying to do. It gets harder all the time. The more money we manage the harder it is to do that. We would do way better percentage wise with Berkshire if it was 1/100th the present size. It is run for its owners, but it isn’t run to give them dividends because so far every dollar that we earned or could have paid out, we have turned into more than a dollar. It is worth more than a dollar to keep it. Therefore, it would be silly to pay it out. Even if everyone was tax-free that owned it. It would have been a mistake to pay dividends at Berkshire. Because so far the dollar bills retained have turned into more than a dollar. But there is no guarantee that happens in the future. At some point the game runs out on that. That is what the business is about. Nothing else about the business do we judge ourselves by. We don’t judge it by the size of its home office building or anything the like the number of people working there. We have 12 people working at headquarters and 45,000 employees at Berkshire, 12 people at HQ and 3,500 sq ft. and we won’t change it.But we will judge ourselves by the performance of the company and that is the only way we will get paid. But believe me, it is a lot harder than it used to be.",1

Questions like this make sense now (in hindsight) but the answer was not so obvious last year. I don’t know if Harley Davidson stock is worth $20 or $30. I like a business where customers tattoo their name on their chest - I’m not sure you can go around questioning those guys! laughterI thought I knew they wouldn’t go out of business. I knew enough to lend them money but not enough to buy shares. There are different risk profiles between debt and equity. We knew that HOG was not going out of business and that a 15% return was going to look very attractive. It was a simple decision about whether HOG was going to go broke or not. I didn’t have to think about what was going to happen to the motorcycle industry. In general, BRK needs to have some money in stocks and some in other assets but stands ready to invest in anything that comes. They had the opportunity to put money to work when others couldn’t and they took advantage.If Goldman had said 12% non-callable – I might have taken that. Harley paper could be sold at 120, so there was some capital gain. If I can make money with a simple question: ‘will they go bust or not?” then I don’t have to answer the tougher questions on the equity, where will margins go and motorcycle sales and demand.Junior securities do better, but senior securities help you sleep better.

396, What is the current acquisition appetite and outlook? Has the phone been ringing?,"The phone does not ring much at BRK. They have said they want larger deals so that weeds out a lot of phone calls. Hurdle now is $75m or 100m pretax, so not many calls, if we get a three or four calls a year, that is good. We are as interested as ever. We wrote a big check and shares for BNSF. I would love it if Monday morning a deal came in. Iscar said that they wanted to sell to BRK or no one. Another company had 3 options-- sell to a competitor (where it would probably would have been worth more), sell as an LBO (where the company would be a piece of meat to be re-sold), or sell to BRK (because they were the only player left). This scenario plays out all the time but it is somewhat accidental. People want to monetize their business, often so they can give away money. BRK is a logical and ready buyer in a lot of deals but they can’t accelerate this process in any way. Another business we own, the competitor wanted to buy them – to dismantle something he spent 30 yrs building. It was probably worth more to the competitor. The other option was a leveraged buyout firm (they call them private equity now) and he didn’t want his place as a piece of meat to be resold. I don’t come to you because you are attractive but you are the only one left! They want a permanent home. Periodically that comes up – we are logical place. We are ready to act when it happens. If it is a $10bil deal I’ll do it. It isn't over. The acquisition pace will be slower than in other years, but it isn't over – and not so bad since we are all so much richer than the earlier days.",1
397," There are a lot of questions you do not get asked. So, what questions would you ask yourselves regarding BRK’s financials?","Can you keep using all the capital you generate effectively for a long time? There comes a point where the numbers get big enough that it becomes very hard to move the needle with capital allocation. It is hard to create more than $1 for each $1 invested. He thinks that BRK can go further now than he would have thought 30 yrs ago but there is a limit. There will come a time when they cannot intelligently use the amount of capital they accumulate and at that point they will do what’s best for BRK shareholders. There is not a lot to say about things that need to be done differently at BRK. It is interesting that they got into BYD even though it is a type of tech company that they had talked about avoiding in the past. He thinks it is because they have learned and that the BYD investment is likely to work out very well. BYD can help solve significant problems of the world and shareholders should take pride in that. He feels the same way about BYD as he did about Peter Kiewet. He and Warren have found a way to invest in their own kind, except these people are better. He said he would not have been good at venture capital.BYD has already accomplished things that seemed impossible to do but they have done them. He does not think this is the last thing that BRK does that will seem a bit unusual. In terms of the BNSF deal, he knew it was better for their shareholders but it was also good for BRK shareholders. So, who cares who does better? He likes the fact that a lot of engineers are being added to BRK.Also, he thinks that they will find people at BRK on the investing side that are almost as good as Warren. Some of these people may even have what Warren lacks. So, it won’t be all negative when Warren is not around.",1

In 2008 many thought yes they could, but would they? Or would it get muddled up in Congress? We went all in, and government succeeded. If we talk about a massive nuclear attack, who knows. But if we have something huge, it won’t be because of our insurance business. Berkshire can withstand it. There could be situation where world might paralyze. Government now better understands the situation however. They did move quickly. Things will work in the US unless the system is destroyed.

401, What economic laws have worked best for Berkshire?,"It is all a matter of trying to find businesses with wide moats protecting a large castle occupied by an honest lord. Moats might be a natural franchise, brand loyalty, or being a low-cost producer. In a capitalistic society, all moats are subject to attack: if you have a good castle, others will want it. What we want to figure out is what keeps the castle standing and how smart is the lord. Buffett elaborated on the “economies of intelligence”: the idea is to find businesses where you have to be smart only once instead of being smart forever. Retailing is a business where you have to be smart forever: your competitors will always copy your innovations. Buying a network TV station in the early days of television required you to be smart only once. In that kind of business, a terrible manager can still make a fortune. Given the choice between the two (a business where you have to be smart forever or one where you have to be smart once), Buffett advised, pick the great business - be smart once.",1
402, What’s the cheapest form of financing for Berkshire Hathaway? Would it make sense to issue bonds right now?,"For us, the best source of financing is our cheap float.

404, Do you have an opinion on whether BRK should or shouldn't be included in the S&500?,"The S&P people agree that Berkshire Hathaway should be included in the index, but for the liquidity situation. Indexing has worked out to be way more popular than anybody ever thought it would be ten or fifteen years ago, including ourselves. The amount of money going into index funds keeps going up; if you added Berkshire Hathaway to the S&P 500, there would be an instant market order for six or seven percent of the outstanding shares immediately - something like 100,000 shares a day. That wouldn’t be good; the price of the stock would go up, but no one would buy it. It wouldn’t be right to add the stock to the index, then not let it be bought.One solution: if it was added to the index, we could sell shares to absorb demand and neutralize the effect of the incremental demand. The problem is, we don’t want to sell equity just to be in an index. Maybe we could do something like what has been done in Australia: phase in the weighting over a twelve-month period. That would result in a market order for 100,000 shares a month, something more manageable. S&P has never done something like that before, but if indexing continues to grow, they’ll have to do something like that.Something that you ought to take note of - many companies do worse after being added to the S&P index. When a stock gets added, there’s an artificial demand for the stock that just can’t last forever. Shorting the stocks that get added can make you money, after they take that initial jump.",1

406, How much has Berkshire Hathaway done in the way of philanthropy?,"There’s a discussion of our shareholder contribution program contained in the annual report. And apart from our shareholder contributions, we contributed about $2.6 billion to the federal government this year.There are other ways we contribute to society. To the extent that we are low cost providers of things people want, we help out those who want those goods and services. Take GEICO, for instance. To the extent that GEICO is more efficient at delivering insurance to customers, let’s say, by 15%, on $4 billion of premiums written, there is a $600 million contribution to insurance consumers overall.We are not big believers of giving away the assets of owners to what we like. We don’t think that companies should pass out dollars to pet charities of the CEO. And we won’t do that here. (Applause).---------------------------------------------------A shareholder asked Buffett to ask his cousin, Jimmy Buffett, to play at a charitable event to help save Cypress Gardens.I don't ask my friends to do such things because it puts them in an uncomfortable position. If they did it, I'd never know if they did so because I asked them or because they believed in it.Let's assume that I was in the womb and there was an identical twin next to me, and genie appeared and said ""You're going to be born in 24 hours and one of you will be born in Omaha and one in Bangladesh. You two decide which is which. Let's start bidding and whichever one of you bids a higher percentage of your estate to society when you die gets to be born in Omaha. I think the bidding would be 100%. Imagine me in Bangladesh walking down the street saying ""I can allocate capital."" I wouldn't last very long.When we were born, odds were 50 to 1 against us being born in the US. So we were lucky. My lump sum should go to society. There's no reason little Buffetts should be running around in 100 years rich because they were lucky.---------------------------------------------------. You have to pick the things that are important to you. For many people, it’s their church or their school or schools generally. To some extent, you should give to whatever gives you the most satisfaction.I like to think of things that are important but don’t have natural funding constituencies, but for most people there’s nothing wrong with giving to things that give them satisfaction. You don’t have to be as objective about that as you are when picking securities. I’d go where my gut told me.With large sums, I’d think about how the money could impact a big societal problem that doesn’t get enough attention.",1
407, Can you tell us what are your goals and expectations for the value of Berkshire Hathaway’s float?,The float has grown at a much faster rate than I thought it would in 1967 when we entered the business. I just tried to grow cheap float as fast as I could. It’s very much a goal of Berkshire Hathaway to grow it as fast as possible at a very cheap rate. The growth of Berkshire Hathaway will depend on how we grow that float.,1
408," Why has Berkshire Hathaway avoided the life insurance business? And also, can you explain why there are discounts on A or B shares from time to time?","We have no particular bias against the life insurance business; in fact, we’re in it through General Re. The problem with it is that it’s not terribly profitable, and you wind up basically managing equities for other people so there is a sum certain at death. We don’t want to wear two hats, just one for Berkshire Hathaway. We want to put our best equity ideas into Berkshire Hathaway and it wouldn’t be fair to other investor/policy holders out of the picture.As for the occasional A and B share discounts: I wrote something on our website about this a while ago. Remember that the most that a B share can be worth is 1/30th of an A share. There’ll always be arbitrage between the two to keep it that way. Short the one that’s higher in value than the other, and buy the one that’s undervalued. I’d do it myself if it didn’t trigger tax liabilities. I understand that there are some tax-exempt investors who are doing that now.",1

410, How does Berkshire compensate it's managers?,"When a business requires no capital, we reward the manager on earnings. If it does require capital, then we add a charge for the cost of capital. We don't have one compensation system.We've never had problems with compensation. If capital is an important part of business, we include a charge for it. If not, if we don't.Our compenastion systems are simple. This is not rocket science though Corporate America seems to make it so. Read proxy statements -- it's mind-boggling the complexity. Compensation consultants have to earn their fee by coming up with a complex plan that they can tweak each year. It's becomes an industry and it won't break itself up. True of any bureaucracy.We could spend $1 million per year on something we could figure out in five minutes. Can you imagine a consultant giving you a one-page compensation agreement? They couldn't charge you a lot of money for that.The main reason we get good results from our managers is that they like batting.400. Yes they like the pay, but it's incidental. It has to be fair, but that is not a complicated procedure. It's tailored to things under their control.Some of our businesses are easy, so they much achieve high performance before the CEO's bonus kicks in. In tough businesses, lower performance requires as much hard work, so the hurdle is lower.Morale is pretty good in Berkshire subsidiaries. Berkshires managers hardly ever leave. In 38 years, we've never had a CEO leave to work for a competitor. We face one management succession problem roughly every 18 months.--------------------------------------------------We inherited stock options, primarily with Gen Re. Those options turned out to be quite valuable. Would not have been if Gen Re had been a stand-alone. Not to criticize anyone, but some people made a lot of money who contributed nothing. Options are a royalty on the passage of time. They put management's interests contrary to the interests of shareholders.We believe in tying incentives to things under management's control. To give a lottery ticket to someone who runs 1% of Berkshire is really crazy. We saw more crazy stuff in the 1990s than in the previous 100 years. There was wealth transfer that has never been experienced before. I'll accept lottery tickets, but they would have no impact on my decisions or behavior.A properly designed option system, tied to performance, can be sensible. But to just pass them out, give a 10-year ride and grant more if the stock goes down, doesn't make sense.We love to see people at Berkshire making money, but only if they're making money for you. Compensation is an interesting subject and I'm going to write about it next year.It's not a market system. Compensation people say it's like baseball negotiation between a team owner and a star player, but it's not. The player is negotiating with someone who's paying the money. But at large corporations, on one side is guy who really cares and on the other side is the compensation committee -- generally people who are not picked for their strong spines -- to them, it's play money. It's almost meaningless to the guy on one side if the CEO gets 100,000 shares of restricted stock or one million, but the guy on the other side cares a lot. You get parity in negotiations with unions -- that's real negotiation.I've never seen a compensation consultant say that the Board should reduce the CEO's salary or get rid of this bozo. They'd never get hired again. It's a bad system and needs improvement. There have been some improvements. It improvement in this area is the acid test of corporate reform.Over time, a vast disparity in pay has arisen, and there's a disconnect between performance and pay. So arise, shareholders!--------------------------------------------------You could make a lot of money working for Berkshire, but it will relate to performance. No-one’s going to make a lot of money for average performance.We have some extraordinary management at MidAmerican Energy Holdings. In terms of compensation, there are two key individuals David Sokol and Greg Abel. For their compensation, I took a yellow pad, sketched out a proposal in two minutes, talked to Walter Scott (who’s our partner in this business) and when he said it looked OK, talked to the managers. The only change was that we had more than 50% of the rewards going to the CEO, David Sokol, and he said to make it 50/50.Charlie and I spend a couple of minutes designing compensation plans. It’s not highly complex, but you have to understand the business. No one formula can work – that would be asinine. Take Chuck Huggins at See’s – he’s had the same plan for 30 years. For GEICO, there are two variables that determine compensation for Tony Nicely on down.From Buffett’s 1996 annual letter(http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/1996.html), the two are: ""Today, the bonuses received by dozens of top executives, starting with Tony, are based upon only two key variables: (1) growth in voluntary auto policies and (2) underwriting profitability on ""seasoned"" auto business (meaning policies that have been on the books for more than one year). In addition, we use the same yardsticks to calculate the annual contribution to the company's profit-sharing plan. Everyone at GEICO knows what counts.""We do not bring in compensation consultants and we don’t have a human resources department, legal department, etc. That makes life way to complicated, and people get vested in going to conferences.In some businesses, like network television, you’ll earn a huge return on equity even if your nitwit nephew runs it (as long as you keep him out of the office). But other businesses are the opposite.You should charge some cost of capital. Measure the key metrics, set a hurdle and only pay for adding value above this hurdle, even if the returns appear low but would have been a lot lower without the value the manager added. If you had a group of network television stations, you would have 35% pretax margins if a chimp ran it, so you’d only pay for excess above this. It would be silly to have 10% or 15% hurdle, but a bad manager will try to get this.In the end, if you have a great manager, you want to pay them very well.* * *Our approach to compensation is wildly different from the approach of most companies, which go through elaborate procedures. The typical corporation has a compensation committee, and believe me, they don’t ask Dobermans to be on it; rather, they want Chihuahuas who’ve been sedated.I’ve been on 19 boards and only been asked to be on one compensation committee – and they regretted it. In that case, because I opposed the compensation plan, I was outvoted – by two smart, honorable people, by the way.I’ve never seen a compensation consultant say: “This bozo you’ve got the CEO is only worth half what you’re paying him.”It’s an unequal negotiation between the board and the CEO. The CEO really cares, but to the board, it’s play money. It’s hard for board members – they just get handed a piece of paper showing what the top quartile of comparable CEOs get paid, so there’s a ratcheting effect. In this kind of system, things will quickly get out of whack. There’s some change now, but it’s not being led by CEOs.",1

413, Your successor at Berkshire?,"We have four people today in the organization who can do my job – in some cases better than I can, in some ways not quite as well. That wasn’t true 15 years ago.We will have someone take over Berkshire who’s been in the organization a long time. One reason is that we like the culture and want someone who knows the culture and how it works. Also, we’ve gotten to know them and observe them.If I die first, all my stock goes to my wife. She might put it in the Buffett foundation then, or it’ll go there when she dies. It has approximately 30% of the votes. By law, the foundation would have to get down to 20% within five years.I think Berkshire has a far better chance than any major company of maintaining its culture when Charlie and I are gone. The people running it have grown up in the culture. My wife and son are there on the board as guardians of the culture.A great example of how this can work is Wal-Mart when Sam Walton died. The Walton family has done a magnificent job of hiring successors to run the place and maintain the culture. The Waltons are there to step in if needed, but they don’t run the business.I think my family and Berkshire’s managers will retain the culture. If anyone would have a reason to worry, it would be me, but having known the Buffett family for decades, I say to you: “Don’t worry about it. You should be so lucky.”During the initial official-business part of the meeting, a shareholder asked Buffett why he had his son and wife on the board, rather than Berkshire operating managers, who (according to the shareholder) have more business experience. Buffett did not answer the question – perhaps because it was not the appropriate forum (the shareholder could have gotten in line and asked the question during the Q&A period) – but I think the answer is quite simple: Buffett is increasingly sensitive to making Berkshire a role model for good corporate governance (it always has been, but appearances are especially important these days). Hence, Berkshire added a number of world-class independent board members this year. However, Buffett also wants to be sure that Berkshire’s unique culture is maintained forever, and he trusts his wife and son to ensure this more than anyone else.",1

415, Succession at Berkshire?,"When we pass, nothing will change, but there will likely be a hiatus of sorts where people might not have the same feelings about selling their business to Berkshire. The phone might not ring for a while. But that will pass because the people the board has selected to run Berkshire are phenomenal and Berkshire will remain one of a kind.Regarding a shareholder’s idea of naming a COO today: I don’t think it works well to have a half-and-half arrangement. We don’t need an operating guy – we have people running the businesses and the main thing is not to destroy or damage the spirit they have. And as long as I’m around, people will want to talk to me about selling their businesses.There will be negative stories a year after I die headlined “Berkshire: One Year Later,” but that will fade out and my successor will put his own particular stamp on the place. But he won’t mess with the culture – he’s too smart and it works too well. We’re a one-of-a-kind place for certain owners. They have a problem to solve and only we can offer a good home for their business.At low pay! LaughterIf we thought there was some better way to make this place run better or ease the transition, we’d do it, but I don’t think there is.The person who would take over knows the business, knows how to make good deals, and knows how to avoid other kinds of deals – which is equally important. Once it the transition happened, Berkshire might even be stronger than before because people would realize that it wasn’t just about an individual.Even though Sam Walton died, Wal-Mart has become a stronger company.In our shareholder letter and in this meeting, we try to make clear what our culture is. We want managers to join us who believe in what we do and make a lifetime commitment to join us. Once they join us, we want to act consistently and be consistent. They see that it works.There are plenty of people who don’t believe in our culture and they don’t join us. It would be bad to have a mismatch. The nice thing about it is that our culture is so well defined that there are rarely mismatches.We don’t have any formal training for our culture – it isn’t really necessary.If I died tonight, there are three replacements. Any of them would not miss a beat in leading this culture.---------------------------------------------------RE: Berkshire’s Next Chief Investment Officer. I mentioned in the annual report that in looking for an investment manager to succeed me, we’re looking for someone who doesn’t only learn from things that have happened, but can also envision things that have never happened. This is our job in insurance and investments. Many people are very smart, but are not wired to think about things that haven’t happened before.In response to another question on the same topic: We’re looking for one or more people – it’s entirely possible that it could be three or four people. We’re not looking for someone to teach – we’re looking for someone who knows how to do it.We received about 600-700 applications, including one guy who recommended his four-year-old son. We’re heard from lots of good people, but the key is whether they could do it running $100 billion. We want to find someone who can run large sums of money mildly better than the market – and I emphasize mildly because there’s no way anyone can beat the S&P 500 by 10 percentage points per year running such a large amount of money. It isn’t going to happen. But a few percentage points per year is possible.Anything times zero is zero and I don’t care how good the record is in every other year if one year there’s a zero. We’re looking for someone who is wired in such a way as to see risks that haven’t occurred and be cognizant of risks that have occurred. Charlie and I have seen guys go broke or close to it because 99 of 100 of their decisions were good, but the 100th did them in.We want to give them each a chunk of about $5 billion and have them manage it for a period of time, as if they were managing $100 billion. Then after watching them and evaluating them for a while, we’d turn over the entire portfolio to one or more of them. We’ll find some people. I had to do this years ago when I decided to close the Buffett Partnership in 1969 and had to recommend to my investors where they should put 100% of their money. There were many, many investors with great records, but I chose Charlie, Sandy Gottesman, and Bill Ruane.

Our average age is 80, so we are only aging at 1.25% per year — the lowest rate of aging in corporate America. If you have a 50-year-old management team, they age 2% every year.

417, How did you select the four investment professionals who could succeed you in the CIO \[Chief Investment Officer\] position?,"The criteria are in the 2006 Annual Report. Records are important. Human qualities are important. We think we can make those judgments, and we made an affirmative judgment on four. We need someone who can see risks, especially ones that haven’t happened before. All the banks have models, but they didn’t have the faintest idea what could happen under new circumstances. You need someone you trust with analytics, but one that also has the ability to contemplate new possibilities and risks. That is a rare quality. That inability to envision something not in the models can be fatal. Charlie and I spend a lot of time thinking about things that could hit us out of the blue that other people don’t include in their thinking. We miss a lot of opportunities. But we think it’s essential when managing other people’s money. You should read the 2006 Annual Report again. We run Berkshire so that if the world was working in a different way tomorrow, we don’t have a problem. We are not dependent on others. It may mean giving up earning a higher return 99% or 99.5% of the time in any given year, but we wouldn’t feel comfortable running the business any other way. Why be ex- posed to ruin and disgrace and embarrassment for a few extra percentage points? If we can earn a decent return on capital, what is an extra point? This cannot be farmed out. Management thought they were farming it out at some institutions.",1

They didn’t cover themselves in glory, but I didn’t either. We would exclude any such person.Comment: There is no such thing as an investor with above-average results every year, yet a remarkable amount of money has been lost chasing this nonexistent ideal. Importantly, as Buffett and Munger state, the job of a money manager is not to sell stocks before markets decline and then jump back in before markets gain. That’s just not possible, so attempts to do so reveal a lack of understanding about investing. Patient, long-term investors like Buffett and Munger ultimately take advantage of impatient, uninformed investors. The best long-term investment choices frequently don’t feel like the best short-term choices.",1

It’s a waste of time—they are 100% ready right now. The biggest job is that they will have to develop relationships with Berkshire’s managers, sellers of businesses, shareholders—different constituencies. Their biggest challenge will be to understand personalities. They have different batting styles, but they all hit very well.

425, Does Berkshire have a succession plan for Ajit Jain (the head of Berkshire’s insurance operations)?,"You can’t—it would be impossible to replace Ajit. We wouldn’t try. We won’t give as much latitude to his successor. Authority goes with the individual, not the position. In the insurance business, giving away your “pen” underwriting authority can do enormous damage. In 1980, Mutual of Omaha gave a pen to someone, and lost half their net worth. Ajit and I talk daily, because it’s so interesting—like how many years can you insure Mike Tyson—but I’m not needed. We won’t find a substitute for Ajit. It has some advantages beyond Ajit, but he has maximized them. He has cadre of 30 people schooled in it, in such a way that would make the Jesuits look quite liberal in their methods. You can’t imagine a more disciplined operation. It would be a HUGE loss to Berkshire if anything happened to Ajit. But the Reinsurance group would still be special, and act smartly and quickly. Every year I think our float has peaked. Now it is $60bn and we have Equitas which is in runoff. I was ready to quit at $20bn, but now over $60bn, and things keep happening. Berkshire has, in my view, become the premier insurance organization in world.

427, Your opinion of Google's emulation of Berkshire's Owner's Manual?,"I’m pleased that the fellows at Google were, they say, inspired by the Berkshire Owner’s Manual, and that they think it’s good for companies to communicate with shareholders.

428, What questions do the BRK audit committee ask the auditors?,"During the opening business-of-the-annual-meeting segment of the meeting, Buffett put four slides up, each with a question that the audit committee of Berkshire Hathaway asked the auditors, and the response. This was taken nearly word-for-word from his 2002 annual letter, so I’ve just reprinted this section from that letter below.If such questions were asked every year – or better yet, every quarter – there would be a lot fewer accounting problems…They should be asked and the answers should be put into the record. It would have a very helpful effect. It puts the auditors on the line. I’ve been on many boards and in retrospect many things went by that I wish the auditors had brought to my attention…I noticed that in Google’s Owner’s Manual(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000119312504073639/ds1.htm#toc16167_1), it said that if the numbers are lumpy when they come to us, they’ll be lumpy when we report them to you.Excerpt from 2002 Berkshire Hathaway annual letter:**The Audit Committee**Audit committees can’t audit. Only a company’s outside auditor can determine whether the earnings that a management purports to have made are suspect. Reforms that ignore this reality and that instead focus on the structure and charter of the audit committee will accomplish little.As we’ve discussed, far too many managers have fudged their company’s numbers in recent years, using both accounting and operational techniques that are typically legal but that nevertheless materially mislead investors. Frequently, auditors knew about these deceptions. Too often, however, they remained silent. The key job of the audit committee is simply to get the auditors to divulge what they know.To do this job, the committee must make sure that the auditors worry more about misleading its members than about offending management. In recent years auditors have not felt that way. They have instead generally viewed the CEO, rather than the shareholders or directors, as their client. That has been a natural result of day-to-day working relationships and also of the auditors’ understanding that, no matter what the book says, the CEO and CFO pay their fees and determine whether they are retained for both auditing and other work. The rules that have been recently instituted won’t materially change this reality. What will break this cozy relationship is audit committees unequivocally putting auditors on the spot, making them understand they will become liable for major monetary penalties if they don’t come forth with what they know or suspect.In my opinion, audit committees can accomplish this goal by asking four questions of auditors, the answers to which should be recorded and reported to shareholders. These questions are:*   If the auditor were solely responsible for preparation of the company’s financial statements, would they have in any way been prepared differently from the manner selected by management? This question should cover both material and nonmaterial differences. If the auditor would have done something differently, both management’s argument and the auditor’s response should be disclosed. The audit committee should then evaluate the facts.*   If the auditor were an investor, would he have received – in plain English – the information essential to his understanding the company’s financial performance during the reporting period?*   Is the company following the same internal audit procedure that would be followed if the auditor himself were CEO? If not, what are the differences and why?*   Is the auditor aware of any actions – either accounting or operational – that have had the purpose and effect of moving revenues or expenses from one reporting period to another?If the audit committee asks these questions, its composition – the focus of most reforms – is of minor importance. In addition, the procedure will save time and expense. When auditors are put on the spot, they will do their duty. If they are not put on the spot.well, we have seen the results of that.The questions we have enumerated should be asked at least a week before an earnings report is released to the public. That timing will allow differences between the auditors and management to be aired with the committee and resolved. If the timing is tighter – if an earnings release is imminent when the auditors and committee interact – the committee will feel pressure to rubberstamp the prepared figures. Haste is the enemy of accuracy. My thinking, in fact, is that the SEC’s recent shortening of reporting deadlines will hurt the quality of information that shareholders receive. Charlie and I believe that rule is a mistake and should be rescinded.The primary advantage of our four questions is that they will act as a prophylactic. Once the auditors know that the audit committee will require them to affirmatively endorse, rather than merely acquiesce to, management’s actions, they will resist misdoings early in the process, well before specious figures become embedded in the company’s books. Fear of the plaintiff’s bar will see to that.",1

430, Berkshire's board and corporate governance?,"The real issue is mediocrity – there are too many.240 hitters on boards. Businesses often settle for a notch or two above mediocrity – there are strong human instincts at work.For many directors, the director’s fees are an important part of their total annual compensation, and they want to be recommended for other boards, so this makes it difficult to arrange a rump meeting to say, “The guy at the end of the table the CEO is no good.” This is mediocrity that is tough to combat.We’ve been on boards and they can only tolerate a certain amount of obnoxiousness, so we have to ration it out. (Laughter) It’s hard to overrule someone the CEO and we’re likely to lose anyway. Occasionally we fire a bullet, but it often does no good.We have real owners on our board – they bought it just like you. In contrast, the boards I’ve been on just hand me stock and stock options.Independence is a state of mind. We think we have the best board in the country, but people who evaluate boards by a checklist disagree.I’ve been on 19 boards and I’ve never seen a director who needs the money oppose an acquisition or executive compensation. They just don’t behave as if they own it.One of our directors was asked to leave two compensation committees for having the temerity to question pay packages. They’re looking for Chihuahuas not Great Danes or Dobermans. (Laughter) I hope I’m not insulting any of my friends on compensation committees. (Laughter). In the boardroom, it’s partly a business situation and partly a social situation. The key is: Do they think like owners and, even if they do, do they understand enough about business that their decisions are any good? We’ve been on many boards and I’ve never seen any difference in behavior based on the nature of the votes that got them there. But I think you’d be blown away by the difference in savviness and whether people think like owners.There are all these fashions on corporate governance, but the key job of the board is to hire the right CEO, keep him from overreaching, and exercise independent judgment on important acquisitions. Even smart CEOs are motivated by other than rational reasons when it comes to acquisitions. Directors have not done well in these three areas over time.The only cure to better corporate governance is if very large shareholders zero in on these things. If they focus on other issues, they’ll have fun and get in the papers, but won’t make a difference. But if the largest shareholders say, “This compensation plan doesn’t make any sense” and withhold their votes for directors, that will make a difference.I just found out that some big institutions are even farming out their voting to someone else. I was amazed. They don’t want to think like owners and we all pay the penalty for that.To effect change, large shareholders – not a coalition of small ones – need to act.",1
431," Given you \[Buffett and Munger\] are Berkshire’s sustainable competitive advantage, would you invest in Berkshire now?","Our sustainable advantage is our deeply embedded culture, which would be hard to copy, and a different shareholder base—20% turnover versus 100% turnover in the S&P 500—and a unique offer to managers. I don’t see any other company in the U.S. that can adopt our model in any way. It’s a very, very long-lasting advantage. It’s not just us anymore. I don’t know how I’d copy it if I were elsewhere. People who want to join us won’t have another choice. Stated differently, a lot of corporations are run stupidly from headquarters, driving divisions to increase earnings every quarter. We don’t do that. The stupidity of management practices in the rest of the corporate world will last long enough to give us an advantage well into the future.",1

433, What is the impact of Berkshire losing its AAA rating? What will it take to restore it?,"We won’t regain it soon, because ratings agencies won’t turn around that fast, even if warranted. It has very little material effect on our borrowing cost. I very much like having a AAA rating. We didn’t think we would be downgraded. We lose some bragging rights in terms of our insurance business, but nobody in insurance ranks ahead of us. We’re still an AAA in my mind. Committees don’t change their minds quickly. We regard meeting our obligations as sacred. It’s difficult for ratings agencies to quantify commitment of management. It the downgrade irritates me. When Charlie and I disagree, Charlie says, “In the end you’ll see it my way, because you’re smart and I’m right!” laughterBuffett continued with a discussion of how credit default swap (CDS) prices can be affected by factors other than perceived credit quality, but we don’t feel confident enough of his exact wording to quote or paraphrase him - our notes: Buffett noted that the ratings agencies often cite CDS prices to support their actions, but CDS prices can be affected by non-credit factors. For example, suppose that Berkshire writes an equity put option. Berkshire collects the premium and establishes a liability on its balance sheet. The other side of the transaction (the put buyer) creates an asset. Then, both sides mark the option to market. If things move in the buyer’s favor, they show a gain. However, the buyer’s auditors urge them to buy protection for their gain by purchasing a Berkshire CDS, since the buyer’s gain represents a potential receivable from Berkshire. If Berkshire writes a relatively large dollar amount of equity put contracts, the buying of Berkshire CDSs significantly increases—and this demand pushes Berkshire CDS prices higher, which to the casual observer would suggest that there’s increased risk in Berkshire. Got that? The bottom line is that the price of Berkshire CDS contracts can go higher without any increased risk associated with the company.",1
434," Do you have a target rate of growth for Berkshire, given its size? Greater than 20% seems unlikely.","It will be absolutely impossible to come anywhere near 20%.

We’ll use book value as a proxy for intrinsic value, as we’ve measured that way for 40 years and will continue to measure that way. If we don’t beat it at all, I’ll feel like I haven’t added anything. In terms of the broader contribution to civilization, the best days of Berkshire are ahead. The future will be way better than the past.",1
435, Could you comment on union and other contracts at Berkshire subsidiaries?,"We don’t have any. We’re not big believers in contracts when we buy businesses. We don’t want relationships that are based on contracts. We buy businesses based on retaining the former owners’ passion for the business. The compensation of the top person at each company Berkshire subsidiary is my responsibility. We have contracts on bonuses. Some businesses are profitable, some not. We have different arrangements for different businesses. We don’t try to hold people by contracts. Contracts wouldn’t work. Our model is a seamless web of trust, earned by both sides. The Hollywood model is contracts, but no trust.",1

The worst situation would be if we ran into so much inflation that people expressed such outrage that we start nationalizing the insurance business. That would be a huge loss of an asset.

437, What is the worst-case scenario for Berkshire's insurance business?,"Business conditions can change dramatically. If businesses permanently contract, it leads to permanent layoffs. Sometimes it’s temporary. GEICO will hire around 1,000. Some people resist layoffs, but if the business changes in a material way, you’d better change your business model or someone else will cause you to. You tend to do it a little late even. On balance, we hope to avoid businesses that have those problems, but sometimes there are no alternatives. In the textile business, we ultimately laid off everyone. Sometimes you’re on the short end of creative destruction. Some of our businesses have a shared-hardship model, but it’s not always easy to do.

440, You are giving a lot of BRK stock to the Gates Foundation each year and they are selling. Won’t the foundation selling create downward pressure on the stock?,"There are 5 foundations that get money each year. I give 1.5% of outstanding shares annually. If they sell 1.5% annually, you have 1.5% of shares being sold annually. That’s not a lot when you compare that to the daily sales on the NYSE. I never sell shares and will never sell one in my life. But only 1.5% should not move the price down in a year. By selling down my shares it has actually led to BRK having a better chance of being in the S&P 500 (as a result of the diminution of his concentrated holdings). If none of the stock had been given away there is no way to know where the stock would be--up or down--but the giveaways should not influence the stock price. A stock distribution to aid charity is a non-event.",1
441, Managers are allowed to operate without interference with Omaha. What would happen if BRK found illegal activity? Would you intervene?,"Absolutely, we have to jump in. We have a hotline. Sometimes we get direct letters. I want to hear about problems. Important transgressions have come to our attention – we encourage that. I skip over the bad breath complaints. Alleged bad behavior will get investigated. I believes we have an internal audit function that works for BRK. Every now and then some transgressions get reported and come right to me.I send a letter every 2 years and asks each manager. A letter goes out every two years, it is 1.5 pages. It asks each managers who they would select to replace them if they died that night and the reasons why I should choose this person. I also remind them that we have all the money we need. We don’t have a shred more of reputation than we need. It doesn’t hurt to repeat Solomon story. If the only reason you are doing something is the other guy is doing it, then don’t. I say to call me. Most realize that if they are thinking about calling me, it’s too close a call and should be avoided. We can cure any problem if we hear about it soon enough, but if allowed to fester it worsens. With 260k people I hope we hear about them fast. We care very much to protect reputation of Berkshire. We have all the money in the world, but we don’t have enough reputation. Averaged out our reputation is good, and that is precious to us. We care more about reputation than business mistakes for sure. Protecting BRK’s reputation is essential. In a sense, you people are part of culture. The ideal is not to make as much money as possible within legal limits. We celebrate wealth only when it is fairly won and wisely used.

Our peak risks are earthquakes and hurricanes, 2 biggest in frequency and severity. Risk is probably down from a few years ago. Not down because of diminished appetite, but because rates weren’t attractive. If rates attractive, we would take on group of risks if something close to worst case was $5bil. We paid out $3bil in Katrina, over $2bil on 9/11. But none of this makes us uncomfortable. People know what we do, they just don’t want to do it. I think it comes close to permanent advantage. I felt no different losing $3b in Katrina. That is our game. Our edge gets wider every year. In insurance we are in business of taking other guys’ desire to smooth earnings and in exchange take the lumps. WB is in a different position. Other CEOs can’t look at mirror at end of year and say shareholders still love me.

450, Why don't you split the stock?,"We have the best investors and the lowest turnover of any major company. Why? It’s a self-selection process. People who say they’re not interested in a stock that trades for thousands of dollars per share, simply for this reason, are probably not as intelligent or as in-sync as this group referring to Berkshire’s current shareholders. It’s a sign, a symptom.By not splitting, we’ve helped attract the best shareholders – people who don’t care if the stock is at $90,000 or $9.Berkshire trades $50 million per day, so very few people will have problem selling.",1
451, Berkshire has bought a lot of shares in the last twelve months of listed companies (2008). Do you expect returns to be between 7-10% over many years? Well below your achievements in the past.,"Yes. We would be very happy if we could buy pre-tax returns of 10%, dividends included. We would probably settle for a little less than that. Berkshire’s re-turns will be less, no question, in the future than in the past. We operate now in a universe of stocks with market caps of at least $10 billion, but really $50 billion and up in order to have an impact. This universe is not as profitable. If we find one with a $10 billion market cap, a 5% position is $500 million. If it doubles, we make $325 million; this is less than 2/10ths of 1% for Berkshire. We have found things to do from time to time to make money. They are nice, but they don’t move the needle much at Berkshire. Anyone who expects us to replicate the past should sell their stock. We’ll get decent returns, but not indecent returns. You can take Warren’s promises to the bank. We are happy making money at a lower rate in the future, and we suggest you adopt the same attitude. You may have better things to do with your money than buying Berkshire. You will find things that are more intelligent, if you spend the time. We don’t think it is the most attractive investment in the world. We like buying good-sized to very large businesses, with good management. It is a nice formula; it should work well over time.",1
452, How do U.S. government guarantees hurt Berkshire competitively?,"It hurts us that competitors can borrow, subsidized by the government— especially at Clayton Homes. The raw materials funding cost us more than a bank that’s in trouble. There are the blessed with government guarantees and those that are not. We have no guarantees. Except for our utility business and Clayton, we don’t borrow much money. Our $58 billion of float costs us less than zero, which is less than Wells Fargo’s 1.12% cost of funds. Of course we’re at a funding disadvantage, but we’re not regulated like a bank.",1

In terms of buying what we’re buying, others can’t buy with free float, although they may have tax advantages we don’t have. We don’t quarrel with those who buy what we buy.

456, What safeguards are in place against breaking up Berkshire?,"My stock will be sold over a period of years after my death. That takes a lot of time. Berkshire is a very large company and will get bigger over time, so it would be very difficult for someone to do a takeover of that size. It can’t happen at all until I die since there are a lot of votes concentrated until then. I told my lawyer I wanted a ten-year distribution period—to make sure my estate lasts quite a while, to which my lawyer said that was like telling his teenage son to have a normal sex life. If we do decent compounding, we’ll be one of the largest companies in the USA. It will be difficult to break us up. I am unlikely to change my views on that subject. laughter",1
457, How do you stop Berkshire subsidiaries hoarding capital?,"Berkshire wants the capital in the most logical place. Berkshire is a tax efficient way to move money from business to business, and we can redeploy capital in places that need them.

Countering this lobbying pressure, there’s a climate of hatred in Washington D.C. at the financial industry that you could cut with a knife—it’s that thick. I don’t think you can predict.

It’s much more fun if someone’s going to jail or tortured in some public fashion. People are mad at government or bankers, and you know where government wants that to go.

I am very happy turning over the keys to the financial and business performance. I write them a letter every two years, and I ask them to send a letter with their successor. I also tell them we have all the money we need. We never want to trade reputation for money. Not only do they behave to conform to the law, but they act as if there was going to be a story in the local paper in the morning written by an intelligent, investigative reporter. There are no budgets. We have no incentives to cause people to do anything or push people to play games. We have no rule against foreign plants. We don’t favor foreign plants; we just do what makes sense. The US was making one billion pairs of shoes per year, 30 years ago. We tried to compete with a great brand and workmanship. We found out it wouldn’t work against shoes produced in China. There are one billion pairs of shoes now in the USA but they’re all produced outside of the US. Some of those factories don’t have the same norms. We won’t tell the world how to run a business. We have standards, but not everyone’s are the same.back to the questions.(https://buffettfaq.com/#questions)Our position on it is quite simple: FERC the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and other regulatory commissions have 27 different proposals in front of them from different interest groups. Some people have been hurt by what you describe, while others – several hundred thousand of them – like the cheap power. FERC will listen to the positions and make a decision. We are a public utility and we will do exactly what the people who regulate us say. It’s entirely a question for FERC and the state commissions.We will not make the determination in the end. It will be made by FERC – the same as with coal, gas or wind generation. Any time you get into public-utility plants, some people are unhappy with the decisions because no one wants a power plant in their yard. People often aren’t happy with wind generation towers. But the world wants more electricity. So we will do exactly what FERC and the state commissions decide. As I said, there are 27 groups and they will hear the arguments of all 27 and come up with the public policy decision. It takes a lot of time.I’m in a peculiar position on this, because when we bought PacifiCorp, Walter Scott and I signed affidavits saying, “I agree that we will not exercise decisions except those ministerial in nature.” We are recused from voting. This was part of the order that allowed MidAmerican to buy PacifiCorp. The acquisition went through in record time, by the way, because MidAmerican has such as a great track record of being responsive to regulators.---------------------------------------------------Three questions about the Klamath River dams in Oregon, owned by PacifiCorp. Will you make PacifiCorp accountable? Problem of green/blue algae, polluting the water and killing the salmon. The first dam was built in 1907. We are prohibited from commenting on this. There are strong disagreements.DAVID SOKOL Chairman of MidAmerican Energy, the Berkshire subsidiary that owns PacifiCorp: It was inappropriate for Mr. Buffett to respond. These four dams on the Klamath River, there are a whole series of issues in the federal regulatory re-licensing process. It will be ongoing for eight years. It won’t culminate for another six years. There are twenty-eight various parties that are party to a discussion about what should or should not happen with these assets. Of these twenty-eight parties, there are four different directions that this process could go. We will be pleased to find a resolution. It is up to the regulatory commission, state legislators, and then each regulator in each state. We are working constructively with each of the parties. We have met with each of the parties, and hope we find an acceptable compromise.* * *. Regulators will deal with those issues. When government gets involved in eminent domain, there are always tradeoffs. Overall you have people with widely different interests. A big interest is the cost of electricity. Every commission that makes a decision on coal vs. gas makes a tradeoff, and tradeoffs are partly an economic cost and partly other issues. FERC Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will listen to everyone. They have to listen to everyone. We will do exactly what they say. We follow the dictates of regulatory bodies. They give us a fair return. From the standpoint of profitability, it is neutral. Society will make the decision.DS: We distributed a study that found an accumulation of bio-algae and microcystin. There are 27 other lakes in Oregon with that type of blue-green algae. It is created from lakes that have a high abundance of nutrients. Klamath is hyper-eutrophic — there’s a great abundance of algae and nutrients. There are 4 reservoirs. FERC does take it into account. Some do not call for the removal of the dam. All the parties will need to come to agreement.* * *. The net benefits vs. losses must be weighed. There are lots of competing ideas and desires in a large society. It is up to the government to sort it out. People are coming to different conclusions about tradeoffs, and generally those are at the state level. The Oregon Public Utility Commission, I am sure, is aware of the issue. They have to consider the best way to generate electricity for the citizens of Oregon.DS: We want to clarify that we are not polluting the water. We recognize the various issues. We have a 50 year FERC license. A societal answer, hopefully, will be reached. I note how refreshing it is to find people addressing a pollution problem that has nothing to do with burning carbon.",1

463, Views on the market and where it's going?,"I have no idea were the market is going to go. I prefer it going down. But my preferences have nothing to do with it. The market knows nothing about my feelings. That is one of the first things you have to learn about a stock. You buy 100 shares of General Motors (GM). Now all of a sudden you have this feeling about GM. It goes down, you may be mad at it. You may say, ""Well, if it just goes up for what I paid for it, my life will be wonderful again."" Or if it goes up, you may say how smart you were and how you and GM have this love affair. You have got all these feelings. The stock doesn't know you own it.The stock just sits there; it doesn't care what you paid or the fact that you own it. Any feeling I have about the market is not reciprocated. I mean it is the ultimate cold shoulder we are talking about here. Practically anybody in this room is probably more likely to be a net buyer of stocks over the next ten years than they are a net seller, so everyone of you should prefer lower prices. If you are a net eater of hamburger over the next ten years, you want hamburger to go down unless you are a cattle producer. If you are going to be a buyer of Coca-Cola and you don't own Coke stock, you hope the price of Coke goes down. You are looking for it to be on sale this weekend at your Supermarket. You want it to be down on the weekends not up on the weekends when you tend the Supermarket.The NYSE is one big supermarket of companies. And you are going to be buying stocks, what you want to have happen? You want to have those stocks go down, way down; you will make better buys then. Later on twenty or thirty years from now when you are in a period when you are dis-saving, or when your heirs dis-save for you, then you may care about higher prices. There is Chapter 8 in Graham's Intelligent Investor about the attitude toward stock market fluctuations, that and Chapter 20 on the Margin of Safety are the two most important essays ever written on investing as far as I am concerned. Because when I read Chapter 8 when I was 19, I figured out what I just said but it is obvious, but I didn't figure it out myself. It was explained to me. I probably would have gone another 100 years and still thought it was good when my stocks were going up. We want things to go down, but I have no idea what the stock market is going to do. I never do and I never will.

I could expand on that question, but I couldn’t answer it. Charlie and I haven’t the faintest idea where it goes next week, next month or next year. We are not in that business. It isn’t our game. We see thousands of companies priced every day. We ignore 99% of what we see. Every now and then, we find an attractive price for a business. When we buy it, we would be happy if the market was closed for a few years; you wouldn’t get a price quote daily if you owned a farm. We look at expected yield, cost of taxes. If you buy a farm, you would look at the cost of fertilizers, what a farm produces relative to the purchase price, price per acre, production per acre, etc. We make judgments. We like owning businesses. They do beat holding cash or 5, 10 or 20yr bonds.---------------------------------------------------Q -Is there a bear market coming?Humans are still made up of the same psychological makeup, and opportunities will always present themselves.

It happens over and over and over.back to the questions.(https://buffettfaq.com/#questions)In 1998, there were incredible opportunities. Just like today, there were a lot of smart people with 150 IQs running around with lots of money, but there was a panic. For example, there was a 30 basis point difference in the yields of on-the-run and off-the-run 30-year Treasuries. Literally, a 29 1/2- year traded 30 basis points higher than a 30-year because of the slight liquidity difference. You could have made a lot going long one and short the other. You wouldn’t have thought this kind of thing was possible, but it happened.The high-yield market went crazy as well. In the span of only 14 months, you had yields go from 25%-60% to 7%. Buffett put up the following chart:",1
465, Do you think the current rally is for real?,"What's going to happen tomorrow, huh? Let me give you an illustration. I bought my first stock in 1942. I was 11. I had been dillydallying up until then. I got serious. What do you think the best year for the market has been since 1942? Best calendar year from 1942 to the present time. Well, there's no reason for you to know the answer. The answer is 1954. In 1954, the Dow … dividends was up 50%. Now if you look at 1954, we were in a recession a good bit of that time. The recession started in July of '53. Unemployment peaked in September of '54. So until November of '54 you hadn't seen an uptick in the employment figure. And the unemployment figure more than doubled during that period. It was the best year there was for the market. So it's a terrible mistake to look at what's going on in the economy today and then decide whether to buy or sell stocks based on it. You should decide whether to buy or sell stocks based on how much you're getting for your money, long-term value you're getting for your money at any given time. And next week doesn't make any difference because next week, next week is going to be a week further away. And the important thing is to have the right long-term outlook, evaluate the businesses you are buying. And then a terrible market or a terrible economy is your friend. I don't care, in making a purchase of the Burlington Northern, I don't care whether next week, or next month or even next year there is a big revival in car loadings or any of that sort of thing. A period like this gives me a chance to do things. It's silly to wait. I wrote an article. If you wait until you see the robin, spring will be over.----------------------------------------------------In response to a shareholder expressing the many reasons why he is concerned about the future outlook for the economy and the market, Buffett replied:I would say that at any given point in history, including when stocks were the cheapest, you could have found an equally impressive list of negatives. In ‘74, you could have written down all kinds of things that would show the future would be terrible.We don’t pay any attention to this kind of thing. Our underlying premise is that this country will do very well and that businesses will do very well. We used nuclear bombs, endured the cold war, etc., but over time the opportunities have won out over the problems. I expect this will continue, barring use against us of weapons of mass destruction – it would be hard for businesses to win out over this.Going back to ‘59, I can’t think of any discussions Charlie and I have had in which we’ve passed on something because of a view on macro conditions. It won’t be the economy that will do in investors; it will be investors themselves. If you’d just owned stocks over time, you’d do fine. We’re unaffected by the variables that you mentioned. Show us a good business tomorrow and we’ll jump.. We wouldn’t be surprised if professionally managed money in the US will have unimpressive returns relative to the high returns we had until three years ago.Our expectations were more modest than most three years ago see Buffett’s Fortune article, Mr. Buffett on the Stock Market(http://www.fortune.com/fortune/articles/0,15114,374423,00.html), 11/99. We didn’t project the end of the world, but said anyone who thought they could sit at home and day trade to double digit returns was living in a fool’s paradise.

468," Mr. Market is valuing Dow Jones at about 7000, and the S&P at about than 800. What is a fair valuation? (1997)","If you believe that American businesses in aggregate can earn the kind of returns they have been earning in the past couple of years, and you postulate no change in interest rates, you can justify 7000 on the Dow and 800 on the S&P. Now, if interest rates go higher, the valuation goes down automatically. And, more importantly, if the returns on equity of American industry, which are at historic highs, and which classical economics tells you would be hard to maintain--if those returns go down, that also would pull it down.I'll give you a little quiz: What two years has the Dow had the greatest overall gain? The two years in the 1900s are 1933, which most of you don't think of as a banner year, and 1954, and in both of those years the Dow was up over 50%, counting dividends. In March of 1955, because of the fact that the Dow had gone up, they decided to have Congressional hearings about it (laughter), and my boss Ben Graham was called down to testify, and Ben's opening comments about the market at that time were, ""The market looks high, it is high, but it's not as high as it looks."" Which brings about the current situation--the market certainly looks high, but there have been huge changes in earnings and return on equity and you've had this big move in interest rates. Now those are underlying fundamentals that have powered a huge bull market. After a while, people get captivated simply by the notion of rising prices without going back to the underlying rationale and that's when you get very dangerous conditions in terms of possible developments. I have no idea where the markets will go, but you have the kind of conditions that could cause real excesses, just like you had excesses in 1973-74 in the other direction, when you could buy businesses for 20 cents on the dollar. People behave in extreme ways in markets and over time that's very good for people who keep their heads.",1
469," The S&P 500 has a return on equity of 22%, compared with a 12-13% average for corporate America over the past decade.  How did we get to this point of extraordinary profitability? and is it sustainable?"," I think a couple of things contributed to this phenomenon that we so carefully mispredicted. Number one, it became very fashionable for corporations to buy in shares, and I think that we helped in a very small way to bring on that.

A lot of profits are not in manufacturing or retailing, but in financial sectors. There’s been a huge flow of profits to banks and investment banks. That has no precedent. I don’t think it’s ever been as extreme as it is now. We’ve invested in and owned banks. If 20 years ago you’d asked me whether it was possible, in a world of 4.75% bonds, that countless banks would earn 20%+ returns on tangible equity, I’d have said no. In part this is due to leverage. A 1.5% return on assets leveraged 15 times is a 22.5% return on equity. But even so, you’d think once everyone was doing it, return on assets would drop to 1%, but it hasn’t happened yet. Some of this is due to consumer credit, which has been pushed to extremes. Other countries that have done this have suffered bad consequences – South Korea, for example, really suffered for two or three years. I don’t think this is a time to swing for the fences.

470," The S&P 500 has a return on equity of 22%, compared with a 12-13% average for corporate America over the past decade.  How did we get to this point of extraordinary profitability? and is it sustainable?","22% returns are sustainable in a world where the long-term interest rates are 7% and where the capability of saving large amounts in the economy are quite dramatic. You could just think that there would be some sort of leveling effect between 7 and 22, that as savings got directed within the economy, and as the competitive forces operate that we've been taught will operate over time, will come into play, but I've been wrong on that subject. Let's say you have a 22% perpetual bond, and let's say a third of that coupon would be paid out. So, a bond with a 22% coupon, and say 7% is paid out, being the dividend payout on the S&P we'll say, and the other 15% is reinvested in more 22% bonds with similar characteristics. Now what's that instrument worth on a present value basis? A lot of money. In fact, it's worth so much that it becomes a mathematical fallacy at some point, because when the compound rate becomes higher than the discount rate you get infinity, and that's a concept we like to think about around Berkshire though we may not attain it. There's a book called The Petersburg Paradox and the Growth Stock Fallacy by David Durant, written about 25 years ago, and it gets into this bit where the growth rate is higher than the discount rate, and it shouldn't work for an extended period of time. Charlie?And you've been selected to be the recipients of their advice. (more laughter)----------------------------------------------------Q - Are corporate profit levels sustainable?Corporate profits as a percentage of GDP are at a record. I’ve been amazed. After being in a range for decades, it’s jumped up. I’d have to look at a chart, but other than maybe a year after World War II, I think there have only been two or three years in the past 75 where corporate profits have been as high as they are today. I would not think it would be sustainable. When they get up to 8% or more of GDP, that’s high, but so far there’s been no reaction like higher taxes.You have lots of businesses earning 20% on tangible equity in a world where corporate bonds are yielding 4-5%. That’s astonishing. If you read a book, it would say it’s not possible. This is high, which means someone else’s share is going down, namely labor’s. Does it become a political issue? Congress has power to change this very quickly. Corporate tax rates used to be 35%, but now many companies are paying only 20%.Corporate America is living in a great time. History shows this is not sustainable. I would imagine that it will not be. In South Korea, it produced some of the cheapest stock prices I’ve ever seen.",1
471," Back in the Sixties, you disbanded the Buffett Partnership when you perceived the market to be overvalued. If you had only 100 partners in Berkshire Hathaway, would you disband it? (1999)","If I were limited to only marketable securities investments, I’d probably put it out to the partners to decide what they’d want to do. But we own many wonderful businesses, so we’re not in exactly the same position.

473, What are the first things you look for in a management team?,"Well, what do you look for in a girl? Seriously, you look for the logical things - passion, an interest in running the business, honesty. Such as, do they love the business, or do they love the money? This is the first filter. I mean real passion; Mrs. B ran Nebraska Furniture Mart until she died at the age of 103 - that's passion. If temperament is the most important personal asset in managing money, in business, it's passion. Secondarily, if you've been doing it a while, you get to know how to do it. But obviously no management team is perfect, so you're often stuck making a judgment call. You don't want to wait forever to find the perfect team. Incidentally, a friend of mine spent twenty years looking for the perfect woman; unfortunately, when he found her he discovered that she was looking for the perfect man.-------------------------------------------------A shareholder asked how the pair assesses managers at companies in which they invest. Buffett informed the crowd that “a really good business doesn’t need good management - and a poor business can’t do well no matter how good management a management is. There are enormous differences in the talent of American businesses. The Fortune 500 management doesn’t get picked like Olympic team athletes. In some cases, it’s fairly easy to pick out a good management. We think a.350 hitter will continue to be one; we don’t believe the.127 hitter who says, hey I’m different because I’ve got a new bat. In business, those are often the managements who say they’ve hired consultants. Once we see ability, we like to see how they treat their shareholders. Tom Murphy is a good example of a great manager.-------------------------------------------------Buffett thinks there are two main factors in assessing management:*   How have their results been?*   How do they treat the company's shareholders? Look also at how management treats themselves relative to the shareholder by reading the proxy circular.Buffett said that he advocates ""finding the 0.400 batters, and letting them swing"".Buffett later went on to say that one of the two or three most important things a Chief Executive Officer does is to allocate capital (i.e., invest money - either retained earnings or new outside capital). Yet few CEO's are trained for capital allocation because they rose through other streams in the business such as operations, sales or finance. Referring still to capital allocation, Buffett said most CEO's, when they get the top job, are ""like a concert pianist arriving at Carnegie Hall - only to be handed a violin"".Often CEOs who are inexperienced in the field of capital allocation will rely on so called ""experts"" Buffett sees this as extremely dangerous.---------------------------------------------------Q: What do you look for in a manager?We look for managers that have a passion for their business. We've had terrific luck with entrepreneurs who love their businesses like I love Berkshire. They'll tell me to butt out if I'm going to screw it up. They are part of Berkshire, but guard their businesses jealousy.We got a book from an investment bank from someone who bought a business a few years ago and now wanted to sell it. The business was a piece of meat to them. What are the odds that they didn't doctor the books?I look for people who have a lot of love for their business. There can't be a company in the country, if you could measure passion for the business, no-one would come close to Berkshire.By the time they get to us, if they didn't have brainpower, they wouldn't have gotten to us. We're not going to see an incompetent but passionate manager -- those got weeded out a long time ago. But I do have to weed out a manager who just wants to cash out.We see lots of businesses that play games with their accounting and just want to cash out.----------------------------------------------------Almost everything we learn is from public documents. I read Jim Clayton's book, for example. There is adequate information out there to evaluate businesses. We do not find it particularly helpful to talk to managements. Often managements want to come to Omaha to talk, and they come up with all sorts of reasons, but what they really hope is that we become interested in their stock. That never works. The numbers tell us a lot more than the managements. We don't give a hoot about anyone's projections. We don't want even want to hear about it.-------------------------------------------------It would be tough to evaluate a class of MBAs and pick which ones would prove to be the best managers, just like it would be tough to pick the best golfer by watching them hit on the practice range.We haven’t tried to evaluate, before they have a record, who will be superstar managers. Instead, we find people who’ve batted.350 for 10-50 years. We just assume we won’t screw it up by hiring them. We take people who play the game very well and allow them to play.I recall a study that correlated business success with the age at which a manager started. It turns out that those who started young did best. Of course, if you work with what you have, you can develop over time, but a lot of it is wiring – I’ve come to believe more so than I did 4-5 years ago. I’ve never heard Charlie say anything dumb about business – except when he disagrees with me. (Laughter) And I’ve never heard GEICO CEO Tony Nicely say anything dumb about business, ever.It’s interesting to think about the odds that the NCAA basketball Final Four will be cancelled referring to his comment elsewhere that Berkshire had written a $75 million policy on the Final Four being cancelled. Some people like thinking about this. My dad wouldn’t let me be a bookie, so I went into investing.",1
474, What are three traits of successful managers?,"Passion is the number one thing that I look for in a manager. IQ is not really that important. They need to be able to work well with others and the ability to get people to do what you want them to do. I’d say intelligence, energy, integrity. If you don’t have the last one, the first two will kill you. All you have is a crook who works hard. If a person doesn’t have integrity, you want them dumb and lazy.If you could put 10% of your future earnings on one of your classmates, you would pick the one that’s most effective at working with people. These are qualities that are elective. If you could pick one to sell short, it would be the person that no one wants to work with. You can elect to be the kind of person you want to be. Look at those qualities of the two people you’ve selected (one long and one short). They’re all qualities that you possess. It’s like marriage. If you want a marriage that’s going to last, look for someone with low expectations. Don’t keep score. Keeping score doesn’t build organizations, homes, etc. I have never had one fight with Charlie. When I took over Solomon I had to pick the best person to run it. I interviewed 12 people for 15 minutes each and I asked myself, “Who would I go into a foxhole with?” I never look at grades or where you went to school. When I picked Deryck Maughan, he never asked me about pay or options or indemnity. He went to work. Chains of habit are too light to be felt until they’re too heavy to be broken. In terms of picking people how do you lead your life in a way that I’d pick you?------------------------------------------------------The way to get a reputation for being a good businessman is to buy a good business.",1
475, Our students are always interested in knowing what you look for when you hire someone? What specific qualities do you seek?,"You look for three things, you look for intelligence, you look for energy and you look for integrity. You don’t need to be brilliant, just reasonably intelligent, Ray Kroc, for example, has good intelligence, which he combined with good busi- ness principles and passion for business and a passion for his particular business. Every business student you have has the requisite intelligence and requisite energy. Integrity is not hard wired into your DNA. A student at that age can pretty much decide what kind a person they are going to be at sixty. If they don’t have integrity, they never will. The chains of habit are sometimes too heavy to be broken. Students can forge their own chains. Just pick a person to admire and ask why you admire them, usually it is because they are generous, decent, kind people, and those are the kind of people to emulate.",1
476, Machiavelli said that a man could be feared and loved. But one might want to be more feared than loved. Do you agree with this? Has there ever been a situation where you had to be more feared than loved?,"I don’t believe in fear as a manager. Ben Graham, Don Keough, and my dad are the people I have worked for and they never tried to get people to respond by fear. Certain industries may be conducive – platoon operators maybe – but even then, if you turn back and desert your buddies.I don’t operate like that. I don’t like this life. Probably certain circumstances call for it: operate this way for a policeman. I believe the most powerful force is love and that is the most effective way of dealing with people. I would not want to live a life where people are afraid of me. People don’t operate well under fear. Some circumstances where mutually assured destruction is the end result, fear is good. But not at Berkshire Hathaway, love is way better to operate. By the way, how did Machiavelli do? There is no religion of Machiavelli 500 years later, is there?",1
477," Mr. Buffett, it has been well documented that you don’t manage your managers. Do you possess a strong intuition about people or do you have a process when you evaluate the management of companies that you are looking to purchase?","Good question. The question I ask is will they still work after they have sold their business? Do they love the money or the business? If it’s the business, then we have a deal. If it’s the money, that’s ok, it’s just not what we are looking for. I don’t have to identify all of the ten’s out there; I just have to make sure the ones I make deals with are tens. I can’t look at the class and say, “You’re a 6.5. You’re an 8.” I just need to find a few 10s. Do I have an intuition when judging a business owner? Sometimes. People give themselves away; I don’t know what it is. We don’t have any contracts at Berkshire; people stay because they have a passion for their business and I don’t want to screw that up. Not much changes at 65 years old. I have 40 CEO’s working for companies owned by Berkshire. Since 1965, not one of them has left Berkshire Hathaway. If I told Lou Simpson of Geico to be at the office at 9am and he could only get one hour for lunch, he would leave. I don’t need to identify every ten out there, just the ones we invest in.",1

They sink faster to a lower prevailing morality than rise to a higher prevailing morality, but they still generally follow the crowd.. I want to make an apology. Last night, referring to some of our modern business tycoons – specifically, Armand Hammer – I said that when they’re talking, they’re lying, and when they’re quiet, they’re stealing. This wasn’t my witticism; it was used long ago to describe the robber barons.",1
482," What qualities in managers set them apart as great leaders, in essence, where do you find the right balance between ""hard"" and ""soft"" skills?","We have 45 managers. Some of them we communicate with once a year, some once a month, some everyday. I usually have dinner with the Blumkins every month, and we go on vacation, because we’re friends. What we look for in managers is a passion for the business. They usually come to us. I’ve never bought from a financial seller. We can’t run the business so I am counting on them to behave well; we have very little in the form of contracts. The business needs to continue just the same after I hand them the check as before. My big question is whether he will still get up at 6 AM just the same with $500 million, and continue to send money toOmaha. I have to look them in the eye and decide whether they love the business or they love the money. It’s fine if they love the money, but they have to love the business more. Why do I come in at 7 every morning, can’t wait to get to work. It’s because I get to paint my own painting and I like applause.We bought a jeweler, Ben Bridge. It was a 4th generation company, with over 100 stores. They were only interested in selling to us. The family didn’t want to sell to others, the employees didn’t want it. I never met him. He didn’t want to sell either, but the family needed it.At Borsheims we have a woman from Zimbabwe. She didn’t even have the benefit of an MBA. We didn’t look at a resume, or grades, or HR recommendations, but were looking for passion and we’ll pay fairly because we don’t want the resent that comes with unfairness. We want people that will work regardless.I got a fax from Pete at Forest River saying this is the type of business you would like to own. He didn’t want to worry about if he died tomorrow, and left his wife and daughter behind. After we made the deal, we had dinner and I brought up the topic of salary. I told him to name whatever number he wanted and I would sign the check. He asked me what I made. I told him $100,000 and he said he didn’t want to make more than me, so we settled on $100,000. Pete called yesterday, and said he wanted to make an offer for another business. We talked for five minutes, I gave him some advice, but I really give them a lot of freedom. I’ve spent $1.7 billion and I’ve never even been to the company, at least I hope it’s there.I can’t look at this group and tell you which 3 are going to be great managers. I can see it after they’ve been doing it for a while. Look at Mrs. B. She had one son involved in the business and 3 daughters not involved. She wanted a way to fairly distribute the proceeds of the business and this solved her problem. She worked until she was 103, and died at 104. She lived two blocks from the store. She left price tags on the furniture at her home because it made her feel more comfortable, like she was in the store. She left Russia and landed in Fort Dodge, Iowa. She saved $500 for 16 years to start this business that has the top 2 furniture stores in the nation. You can’t hire those kinds of people, no matter what you pay them. We’ve been lucky that we’ve never lost a manager to competitors since 1965. Some retire, some were fired, but we give them the opportunity to paint their own canvas.",1

484, Should managers learn about investing?,"Charlie makes a good point. Managers should learn about investing. I have friends who are CEOs and they outsource their investing to a financial advisor because they don’t feel comfortable analyzing Coke and Gillette and picking one stock vs. the other. Yet when an investment banker shows up with fancy slides and a slick presentation, an hour later the CEO is willing to do a $3 billion acquisition. It’s extraordinary the willingness of corporate CEOs to make decisions about buying companies for billions of dollars when they aren’t willing to make an investment for $10,000 in their personal account. It’s basically the same thing.",1
485, Your thoughts on management compensation? Management compensation in a cyclical industry?,"In England, they got taxes up to 90%, so there was no possibility of earning a large income. That was counterproductive. You can get the politics of envy that ruins economics. I think people taking compensation have a moral duty not to take it; a moral duty to be underpaid. If generals and archbishops can do it, why can’t the leaders of a large enterprise take less than the last dollar? That said, it is very difficult to implement. Envy is the silliest of all the sins, because you feel worse and the other people feel fine; maybe they feel better. Rule out envy as part of your repertoire. Gluttony has some upside, with maybe some temporary side effects. Lust—of course I’ll let Charlie speak to that. laughter--------------------------------------------------Q - on executive compensation packages in capital-intensive companies.. We spend a lot of time talking about compensation in capital-intensive businesses. You must include a capital cost element in a compensation system. See’s Candies needs no capital. We think incentives are very important. Boards have relatively little impact on CEO compensation. The CEO has a big effect on his own compensation. They appoint their own compensation committee members, and CEOs aren’t looking for Dobermans—rather they’re looking for Cocker Spaniels. In my experience, boards have not thought about what to pay these people CEOs. There must be incentives to do the right thing and incentives not to do the wrong thing.

I try to figure out the best strategy – and we find that managers stay with us. It is not rocket science. But I spend time on it, and it takes ability to differentiate. An HR dept would be a disaster, and they would have people telling them all sorts of different equations. It requires common sense and interaction with managers. We agree on a measure of what they are adding to company. We have opposite system to GE and Army, and it works for us. Practically nobody is like us. It works, and makes us peculiar.  In England, they got taxes up to 90%, so there was no possibility of earning a large income. That was counterproductive. You can get the politics of envy that ruins economics. I think people taking compensation have a moral duty not to take it; a moral duty to be underpaid. If generals and archbishops can do it, why can’t the leaders of a large enterprise take less than the last dollar? That said, it is very difficult to implement. Envy is the silliest of all the sins, because you feel worse and the other people feel fine; maybe they feel better. Rule out envy as part of your repertoire.

It’s easy to have a fair compensation system like we have at Berkshire. A lot of other public companies have fair systems, but about half have grossly unfair systems in which top management gets paid too much. But our impact on this matter has so far been about zero. We have 68 operating companies and I have responsibility for compensation of 40 managers (some have businesses grouped under them). I can’t think of anyone we’ve lost over a 40-year period because of different views on compensation. We’ve never had a comp consultant (maybe at a subsidiary, but they’re smart enough not to tell me Laughter). It’s not rocket science. But a complicated, confusing system works to the advantage of people who have their hand on the switch.I was put on one comp committee, and Charlie can tell you what happened.We were the largest shareholder at Salomon, we were both on the board and Warren was on the comp committee. When it came time for bonuses, there was a frenzy of envy. Warren pushed toward slightly – and I emphasize slightly – more reasonable compensation and was voted down. Charlie used the term envy, not greed. Our experience is that envy is what really drives people. You can give someone a $2 million bonus and they’re happy until they see the next guy got $2.1 million and then they’re miserable.Charlie has pointed out that of the seven deadly sins, envy is the most useless, because you just make yourself miserable and can’t sleep. There’s real upside to gluttony – I’ve had some great times with gluttony. And we won’t get into lust. LaughterIncidentally, the SEC wants more transparency in pay, which is a good idea, but it can become a shopping list. One CEO sees the other getting his haircuts paid for and he wants it too.---------------------------------------------------. The question is about the unfairness of executive compensation and the effect on investors. Now that you know the question, you can solve it. There are more problems with having the wrong manager than the wrong compensation system. It’s enormously difficult to run a big company, so the greater sin is having the wrong person as CEO vs. overpaying that person.There is a natural tendency toward rising compensation due to ratcheting, the publicity of what other CEOs get and the lack of intensity of the bargaining process. You read about labor negotiations going on for weeks, both sides declare an impasse, they negotiate until 3 am, etc. When was the last time you heard about anything like this when a board negotiates pay with a CEO? There’s not parity in the negotiating process – one side really cares and the other doesn’t.Comp consultants know that getting hired in the future depends on a recommendation from the CEO. Under those circumstances, it’s an unfair fight. It’s a joke.I’ve been on 19 boards and they put me on one comp committee – and they regretted it. They’re looking for cocker spaniels, not dobermans. I try to pretend I’m a cocker spaniel, but nobody’s fooled. LaughterWhat really drives it is envy, not greed. You pay someone $2 million and they might be quite happy until they hear that someone else got $2.1 million.Charlie said of the seven deadly sins, envy is the worst because it makes you miserable. The other guy doesn’t care. Compare this to gluttony, which we’re about to do referring to the See’s candy in front of them. I’ve heard good things about lust, but I’ll let Charlie address that. LaughterCompensation is not rocket science. We have very simple systems to compensate our people. We don’t make it complicated. We don’t pay them for things that are happening that they have nothing to do with.If oil goes from $30 to $60, there’s no reason to pay an oil company executive for that. If they have low finding costs, which they can control, I’d pay them like crazy for that. That is the job you hire them for. To hand them huge checks for something they have no control over is crazy, and it’s equally crazy to penalize them if oil prices go down. If oil prices went down and my CEO had low finding costs, we’d pay him like crazy. This process has contributed to the rise of comp consultants. It reminds me of the joke about why the woman told the census taker that the man of the house was in jail for embezzlement. Because she didn’t want to admit that her dad was a comp consultant. Laughter---------------------------------------------------Q -Executive pay - what can we do to get the country and the issue going the right way?. Compensation - you can’t do much. There are relatively few people that could do a lot, by withholding votes. Big shots don’t like being embarrassed and it will make boards of directors sit up and take notice. It would not take many of the big institutions, only a few of the biggest, and the press would do the rest. You want a good press. The press needs material. I don’t know how you create incentives for big institutions to do that. A lot of checklists that institutions use are asinine. Ben Graham bemoaned investors as a bunch of sheep. The press would do the work if they had material, but they won’t respond to you. Small shareholders can write persuasive notes. It takes a real effective pressure to change behavior when self-interest is in their favor. In England, they got taxes up to 90%, so there was no possibility of earning a large income.

If oil prices went down and my CEO had low finding costs, we’d pay him like crazy. This process has contributed to the rise of comp consultants.

Laughter---------------------------------------------------Q -Executive pay - what can we do to get the country and the issue going the right way?. Compensation - you can’t do much. There are relatively few people that could do a lot, by withholding votes. Big shots don’t like being embarrassed and it will make boards of directors sit up and take notice. It would not take many of the big institutions, only a few of the biggest, and the press would do the rest. You want a good press. The press needs material. I don’t know how you create incentives for big institutions to do that. A lot of checklists that institutions use are asinine. Ben Graham bemoaned investors as a bunch of sheep. The press would do the work if they had material, but they won’t respond to you. Small shareholders can write persuasive notes. It takes a real effective pressure to change behavior when self-interest is in their favor. In England, they got taxes up to 90%, so there was no possibility of earning a large income. That was counterproductive. You can get the politics of envy that ruins economics. I think people taking compensation have a moral duty not to take it; a moral duty to be underpaid. If generals and archbishops can do it, why can’t the leaders of a large enterprise take less than the last dollar? That said, it is very difficult to implement. Envy is the silliest of all the sins, because you feel worse and the other people feel fine; maybe they feel better. Rule out envy as part of your repertoire. Gluttony has some upside, with maybe some temporary side effects. Lust—of course I’ll let Charlie speak to that. laughter--------------------------------------------------Q - on executive compensation packages in capital-intensive companies.. We spend a lot of time talking about compensation in capital-intensive businesses. You must include a capital cost element in a compensation system. See’s Candies needs no capital. We think incentives are very important. Boards have relatively little impact on CEO compensation. The CEO has a big effect on his own compensation. They appoint their own compensation committee members, and CEOs aren’t looking for Dobermans—rather they’re looking for Cocker Spaniels. In my experience, boards have not thought about what to pay these people CEOs. There must be incentives to do the right thing and incentives not to do the wrong thing. Boards thinking like owners is ideal. Not every CEO wants a rational compensation policy. Who would, when an irrational system pays more? I don’t think there should be compensation committees. The board should: hire the right CEO, and make sure he doesn’t overreach. Boards don’t care as much as the guy on the other side of the table when it comes to CEO compensation. Boards have gotten better in recent years, but started from a very low base. I would argue that liberal pay for directors is counterproductive. It would be better if boards were not paid at all. The SEC will question a real owner’s independence. To get business-savvy directors who think like real owners’ representatives on the board is tough. Board compensation arrangements are more baloney. If compensation is too high, the director is not independent. Highly paid boards aren’t going to argue with the CEO. It gets club-like. Having 100-page proxy statements explaining board compensation is wrong. A director who has a lot to lose is loathe to be independent.* * *Q - how shareholders can influence executive compensation.. The AIG outrage was probably disproportionate, but it doesn’t matter. You can’t legislate compensation. In the early Clinton administration, they legislated a cap on salaries, with unintended results. The Clinton administration attempt to do so was the worst legislation ever and resulted in much higher executive compensation. The result was taxes paid by shareholders and all kinds of counterproductive compensation arrangements. All you need is for the top half-dozen investment managers to speak out against the most egregious executive compensation arrangements. That would change behavior. The way to change big shots is to embarrass them. Directors don’t like to look foolish and see their names in the paper. There is no constraining factor now. Every compensation committee hires a consultant, who raises the recommended compensation. It ratchets up executive compensation. We have the honor system— shareholders have the honor, and the executives have the system. laughter. The manager is like the guy in a glass house throwing stones. Sometimes the cure is worse than the disease.--------------------------------------------------Q - How do you determine management compensation plans at Berkshire?. I try to figure out if I owned the entire business what I’d pay them. This is not rocket science. The seventy businesses we have each have different economics – we don’t set a standard Berkshire compensation plan. A BNSF needs lots of capital, others could be run by a chimpanzee, while others with Alfred P Sloan as CEO couldn’t run them well. I try to figure out the best strategy – and we find that managers stay with us. It is not rocket science. But I spend time on it, and it takes ability to differentiate. An HR dept would be a disaster, and they would have people telling them all sorts of different equations. It requires common sense and interaction with managers. We agree on a measure of what they are adding to company. We have opposite system to GE and Army, and it works for us. Practically nobody is like us. It works, and makes us peculiar.W  It’s easy to have a fair compensation system like we have at Berkshire. A lot of other public companies have fair systems, but about half have grossly unfair systems in which top management gets paid too much. But our impact on this matter has so far been about zero. We have 68 operating companies and I have responsibility for compensation of 40 managers (some have businesses grouped under them). I can’t think of anyone we’ve lost over a 40-year period because of different views on compensation. We’ve never had a comp consultant (maybe at a subsidiary, but they’re smart enough not to tell me Laughter). It’s not rocket science. But a complicated, confusing system works to the advantage of people who have their hand on the switch.I was put on one comp committee, and Charlie can tell you what happened.We were the largest shareholder at Salomon, we were both on the board and Warren was on the comp committee. When it came time for bonuses, there was a frenzy of envy. Warren pushed toward slightly – and I emphasize slightly – more reasonable compensation and was voted down. Charlie used the term envy, not greed. Our experience is that envy is what really drives people. You can give someone a $2 million bonus and they’re happy until they see the next guy got $2.1 million and then they’re miserable.Charlie has pointed out that of the seven deadly sins, envy is the most useless, because you just make yourself miserable and can’t sleep. There’s real upside to gluttony – I’ve had some great times with gluttony. And we won’t get into lust. LaughterIncidentally, the SEC wants more transparency in pay, which is a good idea, but it can become a shopping list. One CEO sees the other getting his haircuts paid for and he wants it too.---------------------------------------------------. The question is about the unfairness of executive compensation and the effect on investors. Now that you know the question, you can solve it. There are more problems with having the wrong manager than the wrong compensation system. It’s enormously difficult to run a big company, so the greater sin is having the wrong person as CEO vs. overpaying that person.There is a natural tendency toward rising compensation due to ratcheting, the publicity of what other CEOs get and the lack of intensity of the bargaining process. You read about labor negotiations going on for weeks, both sides declare an impasse, they negotiate until 3 am, etc. When was the last time you heard about anything like this when a board negotiates pay with a CEO? There’s not parity in the negotiating process – one side really cares and the other doesn’t.Comp consultants know that getting hired in the future depends on a recommendation from the CEO. Under those circumstances, it’s an unfair fight. It’s a joke.I’ve been on 19 boards and they put me on one comp committee – and they regretted it. They’re looking for cocker spaniels, not dobermans. I try to pretend I’m a cocker spaniel, but nobody’s fooled. LaughterWhat really drives it is envy, not greed. You pay someone $2 million and they might be quite happy until they hear that someone else got $2.1 million.Charlie said of the seven deadly sins, envy is the worst because it makes you miserable. The other guy doesn’t care. Compare this to gluttony, which we’re about to do referring to the See’s candy in front of them. I’ve heard good things about lust, but I’ll let Charlie address that. LaughterCompensation is not rocket science. We have very simple systems to compensate our people. We don’t make it complicated. We don’t pay them for things that are happening that they have nothing to do with.If oil goes from $30 to $60, there’s no reason to pay an oil company executive for that. If they have low finding costs, which they can control, I’d pay them like crazy for that. That is the job you hire them for.

486, Your thoughts on management compensation? Management compensation in a cyclical industry?,"RE: Management Compensation in a Cyclical Industry?. That’s a terrific question. If you run a copper company and it’s at $3.50/lb., you could be the village idiot and coin money. But if it’s at 80-90 cents/lb., which is what it’s been for most of my life, there can be tough times.We have a wide range of businesses at Berkshire – some are easy to run and some not. We have a wide range of compensation systems. Most people, left to select their own compensation systems, will pick one that gives them big guaranteed rewards.If we owned a copper-mining company in its entirely, we’d base compensation on costs of production, which management has control over, rather than things based on market prices, which they don’t control. Costs won’t fluctuate a lot. Compensation should tie to what is under the control of management. Try to understand what management can have impact on.At GEICO, we measure and compensate management and employees on two factors: unit growth and the profitability of seasoned business. (New business initially costs us money and we want it, so we don’t penalize for it.)If oil is $70 per barrel, I don’t think management has anything to do with it – in fact, they denied they did in front of Congress. I’d measure the cost of finding new reserves over time – the ability to discover and extract oil at low unit costs. Some firms are much better at this than others.RE: Management Compensation in General. It’s easy to have a fair compensation system like we have at Berkshire.

It takes a real effective pressure to change behavior when self-interest is in their favor. I get worried when people agree with us. We have managers that will make tens of millions annually. Everyone wants to be treated fairly. The rationale should be understood, but there is no cross Berkshire rationale. It is ridiculous to put a cost of capital on each business. No difference if 40m or 43m or some other number is used in the business. The real thing is to pay managers for widening the moat that differentiates our business from competitors. I can’t think of a manager who has left us over compensation. Amazing how simple it has been, how little time it has taken, and how well it has worked. Headquarters is typically hated in the field. We don’t want an Imperial headquarters with charges imposed everywhere. We charge for credit, but that is it. Most headquarters charge for costs.",1
487, How important are managers?,"Two things matter: if the quality of the business is good enough, it can carry bad management. The reverse isn’t true, though.

488, How important are managers?,"We’ve spent many years buying many things without meeting managements at all. The $5 billion of stocks we bought in the first quarter are mostly run by managements we’ve never talked to. We read a lot, 10Ks, etc.If we buy the entire business, we care very much about management and whether they’ll behave in the future as they have in the past. We’ve had good luck with this.But in marketable securities, we read the annual reports. Charlie and I read an annual report recently – it was very fancy – for an oil company that didn’t talk about finding costs per MCF million cubic feet of gas or barrel of oil. The most important metric, over time, wasn’t even discussed and when it was touched on, it was in a dishonest manner. That tells us a lot about the individual running the company. If he’s not willing to talk to the owners, even once a year, that makes me question the person. In marketable securities, however, we’ve still bought into some extremely good businesses run by people we didn’t care for because we thought they couldn’t screw them up. It took me 20 years to get out of the textile business. If you asked me to run a tough business, I wouldn’t do it. It’s too tough. Even the best manager in the world couldn’t fix it.

489, I am bad at hiring good managers. How do you assess a person’s capabilities?,"You have to understand that we cheat. If you give me 100 MBAs (I am meeting over 30 schools this year), I no more could take the 100 and rank them - it would be impossible. We buy businesses with great management in place. We have seen their record. They come with the business. Our job is not to select great managers; our job is to retain them. A majority of them are wealthy. They don’t have a monetary reason to work in many cases. We have 19 people at head- quarters and 250,000 around the world. Our job is to make sure they have the same enthusiasm. We have to see passion in their eyes and believe the passion will remain, but we can create an environment to keep them happy. At these annual meetings, we tell them what a great job they did and make them feel appreciated. We don’t have contracts — it doesn’t work. Our managers are appreciated.I can’t be of help if you are looking at a group of MBAs. They know at this point in life how to fool you, what answers to give you. I would look for people with a passion for the job, doing more than their share, who are good communicators. In baseball, you have to hang up your cleats at 40, but our guys go on and on and on. Mrs. B worked until she was 103, then died the next year. That’s a good lesson for our managers. laughter. Story of Howard Amundsen; a young man asked him how do you get ahead?

490, You take great pride in keeping your schedule wide open. Do you believe that corporate America is overscheduled and overstretched?,"Showed his blank schedule book. Bill Gates is overscheduled. I am extremely lucky and I can say no to anything because there isn’t an entity that can use economic pressure to make me do something. A lot of CEOs get into a lot of the rituals that are part of the job. I would rather deliver papers than be the CEO of GE. They have too much stuff to do that is a big pain. Don’t get me wrong, CEOs have it pretty good. I’d imagine that every CEO in the Fortune 500 would be willing to take the job for half of the money. The 76 or so CEOs that run companies at Berkshire don’t have to deal with bankers or lawyers. At Berkshire, we’ve never had a meeting for all of them anywhere. There are no presentations and no committees. They can be more productive, and it makes it attractive when they can do what they like to do best.",1

492, Has the financial and economic crisis changed the integrity of management?,"Everyone else doing it is the problem. In 1993 stock options were going to be expensed. Accounting standards board backed off, and Senate voted 88-9 in support. Accounting Standards Board suggested doing it one of 2 ways, with first way preferred (expensing options through income statement). 498 companies chose #2. 2 companies took the preferred way. I spoke to many CEOs, and they said “I can’t do it, because the other guy isn’t doing it. I would be penalizing my shareholders if I report less than I can earn.” Situational ethics problem is huge. A study showed how rare it is to find a 4 in the third digit of EPS. Many find that 1/10 of a cent to round it up. We try to find ways to avoid inducing that behavior. There is no Berkshire budget. Many subsidiaries use them. But if they submit to me, temptation is to fudge to match it in some way. If others thought others were doing it, they would do it. You want structures that eliminate bad behavior, that minimize human weakness. So much of bad behavior comes not from malevolence, but from the subconscious justification of poor decisions as being just part of the system. Best cure is that people that make the decisions bear the consequences. No one felt any responsibilities on Wall Street, for making bad loans sold on to someone else. It is deeply immoral to create systems like this. Who do you see apologizing for our recent mess? People think they did fine.",1

498," Because of the Internet, certain stocks will show great revenue and income growth like AT&T and Nokia. Would you consider investing in the telecommunications industry this way? (1999)","It’s interesting that you mention AT&T - they’ve done poorly for years, despite charge after charge. For people who understand it, there are tremendous amounts of money to be made in this business - a lot of them in this city of Omaha. But I’m not one of them.There’s a big difference in making a lot of money and spotting a great business. At the turn of the century there were two industries that had never existed before but changed the entire twentieth century: the airlines and the autos. They’ve been wonderful industries but lousy investments. There have been tons of capital lost in those industries, and it’s been very hard to make money by riding on the coattails of the players in these businesses.back to the questions.(https://buffettfaq.com/#questions)As Alan Greenspan puts it, some hard-to-measure factor has caused us to not have inflation while enjoying growth. Technology is probably some part of that. It’s been good for stocks, and good for bonds - you can see it in the markets and it’s been beneficial from a societal standpoint.We’re just cautious in how technological advancements affect our businesses. We try to avoid ones where change will threaten the way a business is making money.For example, Coke is making a product that is fundamentally unchanged from fifty years ago. We’ve avoided lots of winners by sticking to this discipline - but we’ve avoided lots of losers too.Peanut brittle also does not have a lot of technological change.",1
499, Why don't you use Bill Gates to invest in tech stocks?,"Charlie and I put money in things we understand and think we’ll know what it’ll look like in 5, 10 or 20 years. Bill being on the board doesn’t change this. I’ll listen to any idea of his and, in fact, our investment ideas overlap quite a bit. I still wish I’d bought Microsoft when I’d first met him. (Laughter)",1
500," Won’t Microsoft be doing software development ten years from now, just like Coke will be selling soda? Doesn’t that make it a candidate for investment?","You cannot buy high tech companies at prices like, say, you were able to buy pharmaceutical companies for in the beginning of the 1990’s. If I had to bet on anyone, it would be Microsoft. But I don’t have to bet. If anyone has superior knowledge and confidence, they can make such an investment. And they deserve to profit from it.We’re willing to trade away a big payoff for a certain payoff. Bill Gates told me two tech companies in 1991 that he’d buy if he went to a desert island. We would have made a ton of money in them if we’d bought them, maybe more than in Coke. But he also named Coke as a third one, and we were happy to stick with that. The Dilly Bar9 has more certainty of being around in ten years than any software company.There are dozens of software companies selling at prices that imply they’ll make $200 million or more per year in a few years - and that doesn’t happen very often. Only a dozen or so companies move into that category each year in the S&P 500. Look at the biotech companies: how many of them ever grew into the valuations they were given in the early 1990’s?",1
501, What is your opinion of the importance of technology in business education today?,"We live in a world of legalized gambling, in the form of lotteries, and high-cost credit card debt.

We are the world’s leaders in technology and it is an engine that will do wonders for this country over time.It’s a tool.For a student to leave business school and not know how technology affects business and a mind to keep up with the progress of technology would be insupportable. Technology is the future of business. It is transforming society. If I were starting out in business today, I would be very focused on technology.back to the questions.(https://buffettfaq.com/#questions). I think there’s a problem with the current generation. ABC has a new TV program coming out on the subject. Financial literacy is a tough sell in a world of credit cards and calculators. But we’re making progress over time. We recommend working with students to make them literate, and they’ll have a terrific advantage. We hope our annual reports contribute. But people do silly things. On my honeymoon in 1952, I was 21, my wife was 19, and we stopped at the Flamingo in Las Vegas and saw well-dressed people who traveled thousands of miles to do something very dumb. That tells you it’s a world of opportunity. I started teaching at the University of Nebraska at age 21. If you’re willing to pay 18% on a credit card, you will not come out well. It’s probably good for our business. They’ll go their way, we’ll go our way. We’re looking for things that are mispriced.",1

504," What can be done to educate children of financial management, and prevent future financial mayhem?","We will see financial mayhem from time to time. People do crazy things. I would argue some of the problems were caused by the prevailing conventional wisdom taught in business schools. I’m not positive about modifying madness of man from time to time. Regarding the first part of your question, getting good financial habits early in life is important. Not everybody gets that. Andy Hayward, who did Liberties Kids, has created the Secret Millionaires Club show. If we get to 2-3% of kids with better habits it will be good for the world. We will take Ben Franklin’s ideas and make them entertaining for children’s stories. It is good to have smart learning at elementary level, that is better than advanced degrees at graduate level. I learned a lot from a Paper Manager at the Washington Post – he taught me, and talked to me not in a preaching way, saying ‘you could do better if you did this’. Lucky if parents teach you, but anything that brings it into broader teaching environment I’m for.",1
505, Do you think an MBA is an important degree for students to have today?,"If you are interested in business, or likely to be in business, an MBA is very useful. But, what is really important is what you bring to a class in terms of being interested in the subject. If you view a course like accounting as a drudge and a requirement, you are missing the whole game. Any course can be exciting. Mastering accounting is like mastering a new language, it can be so much fun. The attitude should be one of discovery, that you are coming there and discovering. Accounting is the Rosetta Stone of business. Economics is fascinating, the first page of economics describes how mankind deals with insatiable wants and creates the systems to fulfill these wants. It’s great stuff. Really how the world works. Business is a subsection, a fairly understandable subsection, not like black holes, which are fairly hard to visualize, but business is everyday stuff and you are learning how the world works. You are 18-19 years old and learning about the world, understanding how this great world works. The GDP per capita in the 20th century increased 6 to 1. Think of that, six times. Why does that work here in the U.S., why doesn’t it work other places? The U.S. is a small part of the universe, but a very important part and understanding that and seeing everything else against that backdrop for the rest of your life is fabulous.",1
506, What do you remember about your education at the University of Nebraska?,"I had a great experience at Nebraska. Probably the best teacher I had was Ray Dein in accounting. I think everybody in business school should really know accounting; it is the language of business. If you are not comfortable with the lan- guage, you can’ t be comfortable in the country. You just have to get it into your spinal cord. It is so valuable in business.",1
507," You began you university education at another institution, what are you thoughts on the education you received at the University of Nebraska?","The best year of my undergraduate work was at Nebraska; I would call it my best overall experience except for the year at Columbia, where I studied with Ben Graham. The teachers at the University turned me on. There wasn’t a class that disappointed me. I was close to my professors, who actually taught the classes, At my previous undergraduate college, graduate students taught the classes. One of the best things that happened was the day the University was going to award the “Nathan Gold Scholarship,” a $500 scholarship to attend graduate school anywhere in the U.S. As it turned out, I was the only applicant that showed up for the interview. So I won the scholarship by default. My dad wanted me to apply to Harvard Business School. It was a 10-hour train ride to Chicago where I met with the person who was to interview me, and was told to come back another time when I was older. I was 19 at the time. So I rode 10 hours back, wondering what I was going to tell my Dad. In August of that year I was leafing through magazines and discovered that Ben Graham was teaching at Columbia, so I contacted the Dean at Columbia and even though it was very late to apply, was accepted.",1
508, What's the one thing that your MBA didn't prepare you for when you got out into the real world?,"Well, I was -- it prepared me very well, not the whole degree, but specific professors prepared me very well for what I wanted to go into. I knew I was interested in investing, like I say, from the time I was six or seven years of age. So I was lucky that I found what turned me on early on. And I had these two marvellous professors here at Columbia that just being around -- I had read all the stuff they had written. So it wasn't I was acquiring lots of incremental knowledge but I was getting inspired. They were terrific for me. They treated me like a son. They would take me out to dinner. Ben Graham did the same thing for me. So it gave me confidence in myself. It just propelled me into a field I already love with a terrific tailwind from these professors that believed in me. But let me add one point because -- to the MBA situation. Right now, I would pay $100,000 for 10% of the future earnings of any of you. So anybody that wants to see me after this is over -- If that's true, you are a million-dollar asset right now, right, if 10% of you is worth 100,000? You could improve -- many of you, and I certainly could have when I got out, just in terms of learning communication skills. You know, it's not something that is taught. I actually went to a Dale Carnegie course later on in terms of public speaking. But if you improve your value 50% by having better communication skills, that's another $500,000 in terms of capital value. See me after the class and I'll pay you 150-thousand.",1
509, How would you define your character? And what portion of your character do you believe contributed the most to your success?,"The important qualities you need are intelligence, patience, and interest, but the biggest thing is to be rational. In ‘97-8, people weren’t rational. People got caught up with what other people were doing. Don’t get caught up with what other people are doing. Being a contrarian isn’t the key, but being a crowd follower isn’t either. You need to detach yourself emotionally. You need to think about what is going on around you. Being in Omaha helps me in that regard. When I was in NYC, I had 50 people whispering in my ear before noon. It’s hard sometimes, like when the Internet craze hit. Nobody likes to see their neighbor doing stupid things and getting rich. It was like Cinderella’s ball, I think I’ll just have one more dance, it’s not midnight yet. Sounds simple – but it is hard to leave the party. The problem with stocks is they don’t have clocks. You don’t know when it will be midnight so you can leave the party. My partner Charlie Munger and Tony Nicely at Geico are always rational. 160 IQs can say stupid things that sound good. People do silly things, whether they have 120 IQ or 160. You can always improve your rational thought. Rationality is the only thing that helps you. One thing that could help would be to write down the reason you are buying a stock before your purchase. Write down “I am buying Microsoft @ $300B because…” Force yourself to write this down. It clarifies your mind and discipline. This exercise makes you more rational.",1
510," After all your accomplishments, what legacy do you want to leave behind?","I think an example is the best thing you can leave behind. Obviously, you want to leave the right example. I mean, Wilt Chamberlain's tombstone may say, ""At last, I sleep alone,"" and that's probably not the example you want to leave. If what I've done with Berkshire Hathaway - running a unique and independent company in true pursuit of shareholder value - persists and people learn from it to improve the way they invest and run their companies, that would be a fine legacy to leave.",1
511, What led you to develop your values and goals at an early age?,"I was lucky because I knew what I loved at an early age. I was wired in a certain way when I was born, and I was lucky enough to stumble upon some books at a library at a very early age. In 1930, I won the ovarian lottery. If I had been born 2000 years ago, I'd have been somebody's lunch. I couldn't run fast, etc.I was lucky. I had a terrific set of parents. My father was an enormous inspiration for me. The job when you are a parent is to teach them. Be a natural hero. They are learning from you every moment you are around. There is no rewind button. If your parents do what they say and their values match what they teach you, you are lucky. What I observed in the world was consistent with what my parents taught me. That was important. If you are sarcastic, and use it as a teaching tool to kids, they'll never learn to get over it. Those first few years they are very impressionable.",1
512, Are you a goal oriented person? When you were in college did you set goals for yourself?,"I have always liked business and wanted to be in business. This is my ledger from 1950, when I was at the University of Nebraska. It shows the investment in my golf ball business. I had $44 cash and half interest in a car. I also had a brokerage account, but had to buy stocks in my sister’s name because I was underage.",1
513, Your goals were financial then?,"Business, I like the process of business. Money is a way to be in business, but the real fun is the activity itself.",1
514, Who are your heroes?,"I have been extraordinarily lucky with my heroes, starting with my Dad. I have never been let down by one of my heroes. When I was about 13 or 14, we moved to Washington. I was all mixed up for a while, I ran away from home, stole things, but I got through it because I had the right heroes. If you have the wrong ones you have a real problem, because you are going to emulate your heroes. You will gravitate toward the people you admire. If you don’t choose those people carefully, you will very quickly develop situational ethics that can get you into trouble.",1
515, What goals do you set for yourself today; do you have goals you still want to accomplish?,"Berkshire is my canvas. The goal I have is to have Berkshire be general- ly admired for what it is. I am also proud that we do things at Berkshire that are dif- ferent than other corporations. My partner, Charlie Munger, says that Berkshire is a didactic exercise, that it is a teaching platform. We do things differently at Berkshire than in other business which bring into question the generally accepted ways of doing business.",1

519, How do you define happiness and what about your life makes you most happy?,"I enjoy what I do, I tap dance to work every day. I work with people I love, doing what I love. The only thing I would pay to get rid of is firing people. I spend my time thinking about the future, not the past. The future is exciting. As Bertrand Russell says, “Success is getting what you want, happiness is wanting what you get.” I won the ovarian lottery the day I was born and so did all of you. We’re all successful, intelligent, educated. To focus on what you don’t have is a terrible mistake. With the gifts all of us have, if you are unhappy, it’s your own fault.I know a woman in her 80’s, a Polish Jew woman forced into a concentration camp with her family but not all of them came out. She says, “I am slow to make friends because when I look at people, I have one question in mind; would they hide me?” If you get to be my age, or younger for that matter, and have a lot of people that would hide you, then you can feel pretty good about how you’ve lived your life. I know people on the Forbes 400 list whose children would not hide them. “He’s in the attic, he’s in the attic.” Some of them keep compensating by joining board seats or getting honorary degrees, but it doesn’t change the fact that no one will give a damn when they are gone. The most powerful force in the world is unconditional love. To horde it is a terrible mistake in life. The more you try to give it away, the more you get it back. At an individual level, it’s important to make sure that for the people that count to you, you count to them.What if you could buy 10% of one of your classmates and their future earnings? You wouldn’t buy the ones with the highest IQ, the best grades, etc, but the most effective. You like people who are generous, go out of their way, straight shooters. Now imagine that you could short 10% of one of your classmates. This part is usually more fun as you start looking around the room. You wouldn’t choose the ones with the poorest grades. Look for people nobody wants to be around, that are obnoxious or like to take all the credit. If you have a 500 HP engine and only get 50 HP out of it, you’ll be beat by someone else that has a 300 HP engine but gets 250 HP output.The difference between potential and output comes from human qualities. You can make a list of the qualities you admire and those you despise. To turn the tables, think if this is the way I react to the qualities on the list, which is the way the world will react to me. You can learn to turn on those qualities you want and turn off those qualities you wish to avoid. The chains of habit are too light to be felt until they are too heavy to be broken. You can’t change at 60; the time to look at that list is now---------------------------------------------------I tell college students, when you get to be my age you will be successful if the people who you hope to have love you, do love you. Charlie and I know people who have buildings named after them, receive great honors, etc., and nobody loves them -- not even the people who give them honors. Charlie and I talk about wouldn't it be great if we could buy love for $1 million. But the only way to be loved is to be lovable. You always get back more than you give away. If you don't give any you won't get any. Everybody loves Don Keough former senior executive and Board member of Coca Cola. There's nobody I know who commands the love of others who doesn't feel like a success. And I can't imagine people who aren't loved feel very successful.Most people in this room and most college students I talk to will have plenty of money, but some will have few friends.----------------------------------------------------Re: Keys to Happiness and SuccessI get letters every day from people in financial trouble. Often it’s health related, but it’s often debt. They’re decent people, but they’ve made a mistake. They’re not going to catch up, so I tell them to just file for bankruptcy and start fresh. In most cases, they should have done so a lot earlier.If you hang out with a bad bunch, it’s likely to rub off.Look at the people you like to hang out with. What qualities do you like about them? Why don’t you copy them? And look at the people you don’t like.

Are there specific people or lessons you have learned throughout your life that enable you to maintain this outlook?,"I was lucky to have the right heroes. Tell me who your heroes are and I’ll tell you how you’ll turn out to be. One of your most important jobs in life will be raising your children. They will learn more from you than they will in graduate school. My father was a huge influence, and later on Graham came along. I was also never let down by my heroes.I had nothing to do with my own success. My father was a securities broker and after the Great Crash, he had no one to call. Consequently, I was born in 1930 in the United States during the time of one of the greatest capital markets. I was born with the wiring for capital asset allocation. I had the right wiring at the right time. Temperament is a large part of my wiring. I was naturally good at it, and I used some feedback to develop it better. There is nothing to be arrogant about. Gates says if I had been born earlier, I would’ve been some animal’s lunch. I can’t run, I can’t climb. I’d be talking about allocating capital and the animal would think, “Those are the kind that taste the best.” You have all won the ovarian lottery. There is no reason to feel guilty about it.I have never given away a dime that has any meaning on how I live. There are people that go to church and they put money in the offering plate that truly makes a difference in how they will live their lives, what they will eat, what presents they will buy for their children.

523, What are some of your biggest mistakes or regrets?,"We’ve made lots of mistakes, but they don’t bother me. We’ve had no regrets. We are in the business of making many decisions and there are bound to be mistakes. There are $10 billion mistakes of omission that no one knows about; they don’t show up in the accounting. In 1994 we paid $400 worth of Berkshire stock for a shoe company. The company is now worth 0, but the stock is worth $3.5 billion. So now, I’m happy to see Berkshire go down since it reduces the size of my mistake. In 1973 Tom Murphy offered us NBC for $35 million, but we turned it down. That was a huge mistake of omission.In my personal life, there are always things I could’ve done differently. But so many good things have happened. It just doesn’t pay to dwell on the bad things. Finding the right spouse is 90% of it. If you are lucky on health and lucky on your spouse, you are a long way home. Getting turned down by HBS was one of the best things that could have happened to me, bad luck can turn out to be good.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------First off, follow Graham and you'll be fine.My biggest mistakes were errors of omission vs. commission. Berkshire Hathaway was also a big mistake. Sometimes the opportunity costs of keeping money in something (like a lousy textile business) can be a drag on Berkshire's performance. We didn't learn from the previous mistake and bought another textile mill (Womback Mills) 6-7 years after buying Berkshire Hathaway. Meanwhile, I couldn't run the one in New Bedford.Tom Murphy, my friend, bought the newspaper in Fort Worth. The previous ownership of these entities owned NBC as well, but he wanted to divest the NBC affiliate - $30 million to buy, doing $75 million in earnings. It was really a pretty good company, but he wanted to sell it anyway. There wouldn't be many more of it. Network television stations don't require excessive brains to run. They add a lot of money to our bottom lines.We have never lost lots of money in things, except in insurance after 9/11. We don't do the kinds of things that lose you a lot of money. We just might not be finding the “best” opportunities.Don't worry about mistakes. You'll make mistakes. Get over it. At the same time, it's important to learn from someone else's mistakes. You don't want to make too many mistakes.Side note: Warren once asked Bill Gates, “If you could only hire from one place, where would it be?” Gate's reply was Indian Institute of Technology.------------------------------------------------------------Q - Sometimes we learn more from our failures than our successes. What do you consider your greatest mistake or failure?I have made lots of failures of omission more than failures of commission. Things that I understand, there have been a few, a couple that cost $10B. If a business was selling cheap and I did not buy, I consider that a failure. As Charlie would say, I was sucking my thumb on that one. I made a terrible deal buying Dexter Shoe. I did not learn much from it either. I bought it for $400M, but the biggest mistake is that I gave up stock that is now worth $3B.You’re going to make mistakes. You can’t play in the game without making any mistakes. I don’t think about it, I just move on. Most business mistakes are irreversible setbacks, but you get another chance. There are two things in life that you don’t get another chance at – marrying the wrong person and what you do with your children. Business, you just go on. It’s a mistake to dwell on mistakes, it’s unproductive. It’s like Mark Twain’s story about the cat that sat on a hot stove – he never sat on a hot stove again, but he never sat on a cold one again either.",1
524, How do you think differently today than you did twenty years ago? Where do you expect to see the greatest differences in 2030?,"The fundamental things about investing that I learned when I was younger haven’t changed. I am lucky to have picked up a book at 19, The Intelligent Investor, that gave structure to investing and investment decisions. Over time, I learned different ways to apply it. I have learned what it is outside my circle of confidence. I bought See’s in 1972 and I think understanding the value of brand helped drive the decision to buy Coca-Cola in 1988. Through experience, I have gotten smarter on predicting and evaluating human behavior. My wife put me together in terms of human behavior. I really enjoy doing what I do and I get to do what I want. I enjoy talking to groups like these. Irv and Ron Blumkin are some of my best friends and I continue to add friends by buying businesses. I don’t want a boat or 12 houses. I’m almost fully depreciated, down to my residual value. Age doesn’t affect my ability to my job though, as opposed to Arnold Palmer, he can’t play his game.",1
525, Why are you frugal?,"You can’t buy health and you can’t buy love. I’m a member of every golf club that I want to be a member of. I’m the highest handicap member of Augusta National. I’d rather play golf here with people I like than at the fanciest golf course in the world. I can do anything that I want, and I do. I buy everything I want to have. I’m not interested in cars and my goal is not to make people envious. Don’t confuse the cost of living with the standard of living. Bella Eidenberg was a Polish Jew who was at Auschwitz and some of her family didn’t make it. Twenty years ago she said she was slow to make friends, and that the real question in her mind was always, “Would they hide me?” If you have a lot of people that would hide you, you’ve had a very successful life. That can’t be bought. I know people that have billions of dollars and their children would say, “he’s in the attic.”I estimate that I live on $100,000 per year, except for my plane which costs me about $1 to $1.5 million. I like the plane, it improves my life. My computer and my airplane changed my life in a big way and I’m not sure, if I had to choose, which one I’d give up. Anything beyond $50 Million doesn’t improve my life. If I took out $3 billion of Berkshire stock, I could have paid 30,000 people $100,000 per year to paint my portrait every day. I could have paid 50,000 people $60,000 per year to dress in loin cloths and haul rocks to create the Buffett tomb. That’s not me. I believe in giving my kids enough so they can do anything, but not so much that they can do nothing.",1
526, What would you do to live a happier life if you could live over again?,"This will sound disgusting. The question is how would I live my life over again to live a happier life? The only thing would be to select a gene pool where people lived to 120 or something where I came from.I have been extraordinarily lucky. I mean, I use this example and I will take a minute or two because I think it is worth thinking about a little bit. Let's just assume it was 24 hours before you were born and a genie came to you and he said, ""Herb, you look very promising and I have a big problem. I got to design the world in which you are going to live in. I have decided it is too tough; you design it. So you have twenty-four hours, you figure out what the social rules should be, the economic rules and the governmental rules and you and your kids and their kids will live under those rules.You say, ""I can design anything? There must be a catch?"" The genie says there is a catch. You don't know if you are going to be born black or white, rich or poor, male or female, infirm or able-bodied, bright or retarded. All you know is you are going to take one ball out of a barrel with 5.8 billion (balls). You are going to participate in the ovarian lottery. And that is going to be the most important thing in your life, because that is going to control whether you are born here or in Afghanistan or whether you are born with an IQ of 130 or an IQ of 70. It is going to determine a whole lot. What type of world are you going to design?I think it is a good way to look at social questions, because not knowing which ball you are going to get, you are going to want to design a system that is going to provide lots of goods and services because you want people on balance to live well. And you want it to produce more and more so your kids live better than you do and your grandchildren live better than their parents. But you also want a system that does produce lots of goods and services that does not leave behind a person who accidentally got the wrong ball and is not well wired for this particular system. I am ideally wired for the system I fell into here. I came out and got into something that enables me to allocate capital. Nothing so wonderful about that. If all of us were stranded on a desert island somewhere and we were never going to get off of it, the most valuable person there would be the one who could raise the most rice over time. I can say, ""I can allocate capital!"" You wouldn't be very excited about that. So I have been born in the right place.Gates says that if I had been born three million years ago, I would have been some animal's lunch. He says, ""You can't run very fast, you can't climb trees, you can't do anything."" You would just be chewed up the first day. You are lucky; you were born today. And I am. The question getting back, here is this barrel with 6.5 billion balls, everybody in the world, if you could put your ball back, and they took out at random a 100 balls and you had to pick one of those, would you put your ball back in?Now those 100 balls you are going to get out, roughly 5 of them will be American, 95/5. So if you want to be in this country, you will only have 5 balls, half of them will be women and half men--I will let you decide how you will vote on that one. Half of them will below average in intelligence and half above average in intelligence. Do you want to put your ball in there? Most of you will not want to put your ball back to get 100. So what you are saying is: I am in the luckiest one percent of the world right now sitting in this room--the top one percent of the world. Well, that is the way I feel. I am lucky to be born where I was because it was 50 to 1 in the United States when I was born. I have been lucky with parents, lucky with all kinds of things and lucky to be wired in a way that in a market economy, pays off like crazy for me. It doesn't pay off as well for someone who is absolutely as good a citizen as I am (by) leading Boy Scout troops, teaching Sunday School or whatever, raising fine families, but just doesn't happen to be wired in the same way that I am. So I have been extremely lucky so I would like to be lucky again.Then the way to do it is to play out the game and do something you enjoy all your life and be associated with people you like. I only work with people I like. If I could make $100 million dollars with a guy who causes my stomach to churn, I would say no because in way that is very much like marrying for money which is probably not a very good idea in any circumstances, but if you are already rich, it is crazy. I am not going to marry for money. I would really do almost exactly what I have done except I wouldn't have bought the US Air.",1
527, What keeps you up at night?,"I try to live my life so nothing keeps me up at night. I don't like to sound, you know, like a mortician during an epidemic or anything, but last fall was really quite exciting for me. I don't wish it on anybody, but there were things being offered. There are opportunities for us to do things that didn't exist a year or two earlier. So I really don't -- I don't want to be in a position where I am leveraged or something of the sort that does keep me up at night. I did not worry about the ultimate survival of our economic system. We were messed up. Wasn't any question about that. But the plants haven't gone away. The cornfields haven't gone away. The talent of the American people hasn't gone away. The innovativeness of the next Bill Gates hasn't gone away. This country was going to do fine. I knew that. We just had to get things straightened out. And we're well on the way to having that happen.---------------------------------------------------The most dramatic way we protect ourselves is we don’t use leverage. We believe almost anything can happen in financial markets. The only way smart people can get clobbered is if they use leverage. If you can hold them the positions you own during a crisis, then you’re OK. But even smart people can get clobbered with leverage – it’s the one thing that can prevent you from playing out your hand.Absent leverage or just going crazy on valuation, the financial cataclysms won’t do you in. And if you have any more money, you buy.Berkshire is in an extraordinary position to weather any financial cataclysm. While we don’t go around like an undertaker, hoping for a plague, we would benefit in such a situation and have done so in the past. We’ve never gotten hurt in the past 30-40 years by what’s going on in the world around us.",1
528, What do you think were the major qualities that you have that distinguish you from the majority?,"It's always interesting when Bill and I appear together, they don't figure they can do what Bill does, but they know they can do what I do. We did both have a passion. We were doing what we did because we loved it. We weren't doing it to get rich. We probably felt if we did it well, we would get rich. But we'd have done it, you know, if somebody was slipping bread in under the door, you know, to keep us going. And so I think that passion for it is enormously important. I was lucky enough to have a couple of great teachers, particularly one great teacher. I had a great teacher in life in my father. But I had another great teacher in terms of profession in terms of Ben Graham. I was lucky enough to get the right foundation very early on. And then basically I didn't listen to anybody else. I just look in the mirror every morning and the mirror always agrees with me. And I go out and do what I believe I should be doing. And I'm not influenced by what other people think.",1
529, What was your reasoning behind your huge contribution to the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation?,"Well, I wouldn't have given it to them unless I was 100% in sync with their objective, which is do the most good for the most people, wherever they may be, male or female, whatever their color, whatever their religion or so on. They believe every human life is equal to every other one. I am very good at making money. If you read what Adam Smith wrote in 1776 about specialization of labor, you know, he said if you need to deliver a baby, don't try to learn to do it yourself. Get an obstetrician. So Bill and Melinda will be better and my children who will also have foundations will be better at doing it than I would be. And that's fine. I'll work at what I'm good at and I'll let them do it. And they are doing it 100% in accord with my wishes.----------------------------------------------------Q - which part of this incredible act was most important or most concerning to you and why?I actually gave the stock away 15 years ago in my mind, created a trust mentally. When my wife died, I was forced to do something. Soon after I discussed my plans with Bill and Melinda they gave me an original copy of Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations. In the first chapter Adam Smith talks about “Specialization of Labor”, which talks about markets and allowing countries to specialize and work on what they are good at. Mike Tyson doesn’t try to run Berkshire, and I don’t try to get in the ring with Mike Tyson. This is how I look at philanthropy. I started looking for people that were younger, smarter, more experienced, and doing it with their own money. I looked for people that had similar goals, who would do the best with the money. In effect, I outsourced the handling of my philanthropy. It was a no brainer.In the Fortune article, I stated that business is a game that I love because I get to hit the easy pitches. Ted Williams had written a book about hitting and he said to succeed in baseball, you had to wait for the best pitch. See’s Candies to me was an easy pitch. It is not like Olympic diving, where one could do a simple dive perfectly, but score lower than someone who might have made a big splash attempting a more difficult dive. In diving you are judged on the degree of difficulty. Philanthropy is the opposite of investing with degree of difficulty. Philanthropy deals with trying to solve the toughest problems in society, so you expect to fail very often. I personally don’t like failing, so I’d rather let someone else do it. I wouldn’t personally enjoy working on something where I couldn’t get any feedback on how I was doing and in fact, expected the project to fail. My lifespan is 12 years now and I should be able to add tens of billions of dollars to my “donation” in that time. I am going to stick with what I love doing and I am glad others will work on giving the money away.I’m just lucky to have been in the right place at the right time. Another place, another time, I wouldn’t have been as successful. Society enabled me to make my money and my money should go to society.",1
530," If you could come back again, would you want to be Warren Buffett?","I’d want to be Mrs. B - she made it to 104!

532, What's your view on inheritances?,"I’m a big believer in meritocracy. I don’t believe that people should get a big head start in life because of what womb they came from. I believe that society doesn’t benefit from that, but it does benefit when people are rewarded based on what they do.--------------------------------------------------Q - Could you discuss your views on estate planning and how you will allocate your wealth to your children?It really reflects my views on how a rich society should behave. If it weren't for this society, I wouldn't be rich. It wasn't all me. Imagine if you were one of a pair of identical twins and a genie came along and allowed you to bid on where you could be born. The money that you bid is how much you had to agree to give back to society, and the one who bids the most gets to be born in the US and the other in Bangladesh. You would bid a lot. It is a huge advantage to be born here.There should be no divine right of the womb. My kids wouldn't go off and do nothing if I give them a lot of money, but if they did, that would be a tragedy. $30 billion will be generated from estate taxes, which will go to help pay for the war in Iraq and other things. If you take away the estate tax, that money will have to come from somewhere else. If not from estate taxes then you inherently get it from poorer citizens. Less than 2% of estates will pay the estate tax. They would still have $50 million left over on average. I think those that get the lucky tickets should pay the most to the common causes of society. I believe in a big redistribution. Wealth is a bunch of claim checks that I can turn in for houses, etc. To pass those claim checks down to the next generation is the wrong approach. But for those that think I am perpetuating the welfare state, consider if you are born to a rich parent. You get a whole bunch of stocks right at the beginning of your life, and thus you are sort of on a welfare state of support from your rich parents from the beginning. What's the difference?At $100,000 a year, I can find 10 people to paint my portraits to find the perfect one. I have that kind of money. But that is a waste, as those people could be doing something useful. I feel the same way about my kids and other heirs. They should be doing things that help to contribute to society.",1
533, What feedback mechanisms do you have in place?,"It is part of human nature to interpret all new information such that prior conclusions remain intact.Having a good partner is key. Charlie will not accept anything I say because I say it. It's great to have a partner who will tell you when you're thinking is wrong.The typical corporate organization is structured so that a CEOs beliefs and biases are reinforced. Staffs won't give you any contrary recommendations -- they'll just come back with whatever the CEO wants. And the Board of Directors won't act as a check, so the CEO pretty much gets what he wants.Having good feedback mechanisms is terribly important. We have a very good system.""",1

I’ve never given up anything that made a difference to me. There are people that drop in the collection plate an amount that makes a difference in their lives. I’ve never given a penny that way. I’ve lived a long time, which gives you a huge advantage in accumulating money. I’m giving away excess, not necessity. What I am doing is useful, but it isn’t on a par with people who give real money. Doris Doris Buffett, Warren’s older sister gives away money and time which is a real cost—she gives help beyond the money. She is retail; I am wholesale. You should give to things that you personally have interest in. I won’t prioritize your giving. If you hang around Charlie enough, you get the sunny side of life. laughter",1

543, Why do you support Planned Parenthood?,"The questioner attacked Buffett’s charitable support of Planned Parenthood and was roundly booed.I think Planned Parenthood is a terrific organization. I really think it’s too bad that for millennia women, not only in the U.S. but over the world, have involuntarily had forced upon them the bearing of babies, generally by governments run by men. ApplauseI think it’s an important issue that doesn’t have a natural funding constituency – it’s not like putting your name on a hospital. I think if we’d had a Supreme Court with nine women on it from the beginning, I don’t think a question like yours would even be asked. I think it’s wonderful that women can make reproductive choices. I hope you’ll respect my opinion as I do yours. More applause",1
544, What is the best question you've ever been asked?,"I guess the best question I've ever asked is my wife to marry me. Her answer might have been her worst!

You can't know those answers when you're young. For both men and women, the most important decision you'll ever make is your choice of spouse. The most important job is raising children. The first five years are very important in a child's life. The Gateses do a good job raising their children and have thought about it a lot.",1

554, I know you like baseball. My favorite team is the Chicago Cubs. Would you like to buy the Chicago Cubs from Sam Zell? Is it a good investment?,"It’s been a good investment. Earnings haven’t gone up so much, though cable television expanded the stadium. There were 40,000 seats in 1939, and cable multiplied seats in a huge way, and a lot of it went to the players, but some stuck to the owners. When I was your age, I thought I would buy a team. If the Cubs sell for $700 million, I don’t think I would buy at that price—but there is a psychological income to some owners. It is a way to instant celebrity. A certain percentage of people want the route to that life. Many people have loads of money. I’ve had calls from others about the Cubs. I think I will leave that to you. Charlie is a harder sell. I might do something like that. If you keep reading books, you’ll learn a lot. If you read 20 books, you can learn a hell of a lot. Having the right parents is very lucky.

555," You have said that your assistant pays a higher tax rate than you does and that to be equitable the tax rate should be higher on you than on others. In reality, the bulk of estate will not be taxed due to your charitable donations. How do you change the system so people like you pay more tax?","A wealth tax is an answer. If you want to give away all of your money it is a great tax dodge. People should give away all their money because the money could do a lot of good. In the US, if we spend 25% of GDP then we cannot keep taxation at 15% of GDP. Two classy people are heading up the deficit commission--Erskine Boles and Alan Simpson. They are going to have to recommend higher taxes and lower expenditures and after that they won’t be popular. We won’t be able to increase taxes on lower income people so it’s going to be a tough equation to solve.Take BRK shares for example: I will not ever sell a share. I have everything I needs in my life and because BRK does well I can give shares away. Some people might suggest that I should give money away to the federal government instead. But in reality we would not want to give that money to the federal government implying that it would not be used efficiently. Those who worry about Warren’s taxes are wasting their time. Warren will have left it all when he dies.back to the questions.(https://buffettfaq.com/#questions)Well it’s not a death tax. 2.2 million people die in the US and out of that only 4,000 estates will be taxed. The federal government collects $30 billion in tax revenue per year from estate taxes and a high percentage of the heirs of these estates will receive $50 million or more.We have to ask ourselves what is the proper tax policy for our society. Let me illustrate with a game. Imagine 24 hours before your birth a genie comes to you and lets you design the world into which you will come. You define all of the political, economic, and societal facets of the world. But there is one catch. You have to draw a ticket from a pool of 6 billion. On this ticket will be your characteristics in this world, i.e. if you are born in the US or Bangladesh, if you are male or female, black or white, retarded or normal, etc. What would you do? You would design a world with rules that would initially foster abundance. A world that produces lots of output where everyone is productive. You would create an abundant society. Secondly, you would want justice. You would want the output to be spread out. You would design a world where there was freedom from fear, freedom from fear of old age. You would want equality of opportunity, a market system, and that the best people were in the right places. You would want a world that would take care of the people who got the bad tickets. This has nothing to do with religion, I’m agnostic. At the time that I was born, the odds were about 50 to 1 that I was born in the United States. I won the ovarian lottery.You would make sure all of the lucky tickets are incentivized to keep working. Also you would want others to have equality of opportunity, not equality of outcome though. One bigger thing would be a good system of the rule of law. You would also want to make sure you have people in the right places according to their talents. You would also want to help others that have no opportunity. I could set it up so that my descendants would not have to work for ten generations. So I would end up effectively taking my descendants out of the pool of proactive people. The descendants of wealthy people could potentially become welfare recipients. Lots of families (I won’t name names) create dynasties where society contributes to them just because they are part of the “lucky sperm club”. Instead of using food stamps, they would have stocks and bonds. The estate tax modifies the ability to create a family dynasty that takes the descendants out of the work pool, the group of productive citizens.We all participated in the ovarian lottery, it’s probably the most important thing we have ever done. In fact, you all are in business school, you are pretty smart and you have a bright future ahead of you; if you had the chance to trade in your lottery ticket for the chance to pick 100 tickets of which you would have to take one. Would you do it? I would argue you should not. Out of the 100, only 4 or 5 would be born in the US. Out of that only not many would be headed on the path you are headed down. So we are part of the top 1% in society, we are pretty lucky. My descendants are part of the top 1 tenth of one percent of society. This means that you are in the luckiest 1% of the world.",1
556, Is all your media exposure the best use of your time?,"Probably not. But there are a lot of things I do that aren’t. I play 12 hrs of bridge a week, and that isn’t good for shareholders either! If you want a record of things, I would much rather have a record on Charlie Rose where people can go back to it. I like the idea of being judged by my own words, rather than someone trying to write a few words and summarizing me. That versus a one hour interview where reporter is shopping for a few quotes to fit – I prefer TV. I like the accuracy of the reporting. Best use of time? It works fine. One story however, because TV isn’t perfect – you have to be careful on a broadcast. Charlie Rose did interview and taped me on Friday morning. During tape they were showing great railroad scenes, including a montage of railroad movies with Marilyn Monroe in Some Like It Hot and Grace Kelly. Then he asked me some question – and I said I would have paid more for BNSF if they included Marilyn Monroe and Grace Kelly. But the recording ran 106 minutes and they took out the montage of Grace Kelly and Marilyn – but left in my response -- it looked like I had come up with this out of the blue!",1
557," I worked in the paper and packaging business this past summer and really enjoyed my experience. None of my classmates are interested in the paper business and the company I worked for has not had MBA interns in years. Clearly the paper business has its challenges, but do you see this as an opportunity or a roadblock?","Well, you've got it right that the paper business is challenged. High capital intensity, low margins, cyclical. It is a brutal business; no o­ne cares who made the box their Dell computer came shipped in. In general, commodity businesses, even you're the low-cost producer, are difficult. There are generally two recommendations I offer to college and business school graduates. The most important thing about where you work is that you admire/love it. So it sounds like you liked your experience, and that's great. But we come to my second recommendation, which is to get o­n the right train; that is, moving in the right direction. There's no course in business school called ""Getting o­n the Right Train"", but it's really important. You can be an average passenger but if you get o­n the right train it will carry you a long way. You want to learn from experience, but you want to learn from other people's experience when you can. Managing your career is like investing - the degree of difficulty does not count. So you can save yourself money and pain by getting on the right train.",1

And I have also seen an awful lot of people succeed that do; and those are the ones I admire and they are the ones I want to associate with. Honesty is a terrific policy. What do you look back on in terms of whether you have been a success? You have certain things you want to achieve, but if you don’t have the love and respect of peo- ple, you are always a failure. That is the one thing you must earn, it can never be bought. No one that has the love and respect of others is ever a failure.",1

The only catch is that it is the only car they will ever have.

561," At the Wesco annual meeting last year, Charlie said, ""The best way to get success is to deserve success"". Do you recall anything from your experience which best demonstrates how you were able to position yourself to deserve success, and do you have any advice for students on how they can position themselves to deserve success as well?","Behaving decent is a large part of it. Out of school I offered to work for Graham for free and he said I was overpriced. I tried to be useful and visible to him. I gave him stock tips and kept up with him. Almost always good things come from good behavior. Don’t keep score in life. Tom Murphy does not keep score. He keeps doing 20 things for me and I can only hope to return the favor. Keeping score is terrible in marriage and terrible in business. I put myself in the seller’s shoes. With most humans there is a great desire to reciprocate. If you do something for them, they will do 2X for you. How rare is it to work during lunch hours and be the first one there in the morning. You’ll get noticed if you do something extra. It’s good to have a willingness to pitch in when you aren’t going to get credit for it. Charlie and I partnered up in 1959. We always both think we’re right. We disagree but we’ve never fought. And we’ve never held past mistakes over each other’s heads. I recommend reading “Poor Charlie’s Almanack”. It’s amazing, has sold 50,000 copies and it’s still sold independently.",1
562, What advice would you give the average person in the U.S.?,"It’s hard to give advice to someone who might lose their job. My Dad went to work on August 13, 1931 to find out the bank where he worked and held all our money had closed. He had no job and no money and two kids. You want to be as prepared as you can and you just don’t want to have debt. Medical problems cause a lot of the grief and lots of credit card debt. Credit cards are poison. If you make a dollar, only spend 95 cents, not $1.05. You should be ahead of the game all the time rather than behind as it is harder to work your way out of a hole. You want to play the game from strength, and you have to think ahead. People don’t always want to hear advice when things are going well. People risked everything they had and needed for something they didn’t have or need. Charlie once said, “The problem isn’t getting rich, it’s staying sane.",1
563, What general advice would you give to students?,"I would like to talk for just one minute to the students about your future when you leave here. Because you will learn a tremendous amount about investments, you all have the ability to do well; you all have the IQ to do well. You all have the energy and initiative to do well or you wouldn't be here. Most of you will succeed in meeting your aspirations. But in determining whether you succeed there is more to it than intellect and energy. I would like to talk just a second about that. In fact, there was a guy, Pete Kiewit in Omaha, who used to say, he looked for three things in hiring people: integrity, intelligence and energy. And he said if the person did not have the first two, the later two would kill him, because if they don't have integrity, you want them dumb and lazy.We want to talk about the first two because we know you have the last two. You are all second-year MBA students, so you have gotten to know your classmates. Think for a moment that I granted you the right--you can buy 10% of one of your classmate’s earnings for the rest of their lifetime. You can't pick someone with a rich father; you have to pick someone who is going to do it on his or her own merit. And I gave you an hour to think about it.Will you give them an IQ test and pick the one with the highest IQ? I doubt it. Will you pick the one with the best grades? The most energetic? You will start looking for qualitative factors, in addition to (the quantitative) because everyone has enough brains and energy. You would probably pick the one you responded the best to, the one who has the leadership qualities, the one who is able to get other people to carry out their interests. That would be the person who is generous, honest and who gave credit to other people for their own ideas. All types of qualities. Whomever you admire the most in the class. Then I would throw in a hooker. In addition to this person you had to go short one of your classmates.That is more fun. Who do I want to go short? You wouldn't pick the person with the lowest IQ, you would think about the person who turned you off, the person who is egotistical, who is greedy, who cuts corners, who is slightly dishonest.As you look at those qualities on the left and right hand side, there is one interesting thing about them, it is not the ability to throw a football 60 yards, it is not the ability the run the 100 yard dash in 9.3 seconds, it is not being the best looking person in the class, they are all qualities that if you really want to have the ones on the left hand side, you can have them.They are qualities of behavior, temperament, character that are achievable, they are not forbidden to anybody in this group. And if you look at the qualities on the right hand side the ones that turn you off in other people, there is not a quality there that you have to have. You can get rid of it. You can get rid of it a lot easier at your age than at my age, because most behaviors are habitual. The chains of habit are too light to be felt until they are too heavy to be broken. There is no question about it. I see people with these self-destructive behavior patterns at my age or even twenty years younger and they really are entrapped by them.They go around and do things that turn off other people right and left. They don't need to be that way but by a certain point they get so they can hardly change it. But at your age you can have any habits, any patterns of behavior that you wish. It is simply a question of which you decide.If you did this.Ben Graham looked around at the people he admired and Ben Franklin did this before him. Ben Graham did this in his low teens and he looked around at the people he admired and he said, ""I want to be admired, so why don't I behave like them?"" And he found out that there was nothing impossible about behaving like them. Similarly he did the same thing on the reverse side in terms of getting rid of those qualities. I would suggest is that if you write those qualities down and think about them a while and make them habitual, you will be the one you want to buy 10% of when you are all through. And the beauty of it is that you already own 100% of yourself and you are stuck with it. So you might as well be that person, that somebody else.----------------------------------------------------------First of all, I'd say marry the right person. And I'm serious about that.It will make more difference in your life. It will change your aspiration, all kind of things. It's enormously important who you marry. Beyond that, I would say that do what you would do if you were in my position, where the money means nothing to you. At 79,.I work every day. And it's what I want to do more than anything else in the world. The closer you can come to that early on in your life, you know the more fun you're going to have in life and really the better you're going to do. So don't be driven where you think the last dollar is presently or anything of that sort. And then also go to work, if possible, for an organization or an individual that you admire. I mean I offered to go to work for Ben Graham because there was nobody I admired more in the business than him. I didn't care what he paid me. When he finally did hire me in 1954, I moved from Omaha to New York and I didn't know what I was getting paid until I got my first paycheck. But I knew I wanted to work for Ben Graham. And I knew I would jump out of bed every morning and be excited about what I would do and I would go home at night smarter than I was in the morning. Go to work at a job that turns you on and a person that turns you on and institution.",1

Missouri, Florida, Columbia Bruce Greenwald and others, Stanford Jack McDonald – a lot of schools – have people in those departments who are doing a great job.My experience with the students is that they generally have their heads screwed on right.I enjoy all the students coming out, but they all think they’re going to get rich by following in our footsteps.

I took that Carnegie course, and then I went to the University of Omaha to start teaching— knowing I had to get in front of people. Ability to communicate in writing and speaking—it is under- taught—and enormously important. If you can communicate well, you have an enormous advantage. Force yourself into situations where you have to develop those abilities. It helps to do it in front of similar people to start. At Dale Carnegie—they made us stand on tables.

If you go too tough on children, they go crazy later on. There are plenty of people I don’t advise to save. If you already have money in a 401(k) and Social Security and have a little left over, who is to say you should give up taking your children to Disney World and the associated happiness now for a 30-foot boat later vs. a 20-foot boat later. There are benefits to spending now. It is not always better to save 10% than 5%, but definitely better than spending 105%. You need to live a life that is true to yourself.

One can best prepare themselves for the economic future by investing in your own education. If you study hard and learn at a young age, you will be in the best circumstances to secure your future.

582," I teach at a community college in Florida, teaching students to invest in themselves. Financial independence and freedom. Slow and steady wins the race. Law of reciprocity. Etc, etc, etc. What else should I be doing?","Laughing I’m ready to hire your entire class right now. The most important investment is in themselves. Potential horsepower is rarely achieved. Just imagine you are 16 and your parents are going to give you the car of your choice. But the catch is that it is the only car you would get for the rest of your life. How would you choose to proceed? Of course, you will read the manual 5 times. How would you treat it? You’ll keep it garaged, change the oil twice as frequently as you’re supposed to, and keep rust to a minimum because you know it needs to last a lifetime. I tell students that you get only one body and one mind. You’d better treat them the same way. It’s hard to change habits at age 50 or 60. Anything students do to invest in body and mind is good, particularly in the mind. We didn’t work too hard on bodies around here. It pays off in an extraordinary way. The best asset is your own self. You can become, to an enormous degree, the person you want to be. When I talk to university classes, I ask them to buy one classmate to own his or her earnings for the rest of their life. They would pick the person not with the highest IQ, but the ones who are the most effective; the ones you want to be around. These people are easy to work with, generous, on time, don’t claim credit, help others. Those are good habits to develop. Leaders are effective because people want to be around them. I have a specific suggestion that I would add to your extensive repertoire. I would teach them to avoid being manipulated by vendors and lenders by using their own tricks against them. Cialdini has a new book—it is called Yes! It is not as good as Influence, but I recommend it and recommend adding both of those books to your repertoire.",1
583," What advice do you give to young entrepreneurs? I am starting a business, and I want it to be successful. Aristotle, when asked definition of wealth, said it is he who spends less than he earns.","I predict you are going to build one. If you start with that principle you enunciated, and there are similar principles. There is nothing like following your passion. Managers -- some went to business school, some didn’t. The common factor is they love what they do. You have to find that in life. It was dumb luck my Dad was in securities business. I got entranced with that. If you find something that turns you on, you’ll do well in it. There isn’t that much competition. There won’t be many that run faster than you in the race you ELECT to run. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. We had 70 managers, and some didn’t go to high school. Mrs B didn’t do a day of school in her life. NFM is 78 acres, 400m of sales, largest furniture store in USA, with $500 of capital paid in. She couldn’t read or write and never went to school a day in her life. In her 90’s she invited me over to her house for dinner, which was very unusual. The couches and tables in her house - they all had price tags – it made her feel at home! “The power which resides in him is new in nature, and none but he knows what that is which he can do, nor does he know until he has tried.” Emerson.

584, What's a good thing to buy and than sell for a profit? For example candy or something in that nature?,"I always advise people to get involved in a business they understand. Whether it is candy, car washes or lemonade, doesn't matter. When you buy something and sell it for a profit, you need to make sure that you are adding value to justify the increased price. That is where the profit will come from. If you start a lemonade stand for example, you can buy your lemons and your sugar and materials for a certain cost. When you make them into lemonade, you will charge more than your original cost because your labor has created a new product from the original materials. Do something you know and like, and it will never be work.",1

Whatever you do, be sure to provide a good service at a fair price.",1
586, What are the best ways for a 10-year-old to earn money?,"That was a subject I gave a lot of thought to when I was 10. You’re probably a little young to deliver papers. I got half my capital from that – I liked it because I could do it by myself. You can do it when you’re 12 or 13. I tried 20 different businesses by the time I got out of high school. The best was a pinball-machine business, but I wouldn’t recommend it now.I saw a study that correlated business success with a range of variables like grades, parents, whether one attended business school – and they found it correlated best with the age at which you first started in business. You see this in athletics and music as well.Look for what people don’t want to do for themselves. Ask around, see what other kids have done. A paper route is a good idea.If some people in debt worked an extra one-and-a-half hours a day, they could pay off their debt. When I was young, I read The Richest Man in Babylon, which said to under-spend your income and invest the difference. Lo and behold, I did this and it worked. I got the idea to add a mental compound interest too, so I decided I would sell myself the best hour of the day to improving my own mind, and the world could buy the rest of the time. It sounds selfish, but it worked.If you become very reliable and stay that way, it will be very hard to fail in doing anything you want.",1

Just look at the whole picture. Don’t treat them as separate pots. I don’t think about what entities things are in. With that, I’ll turn it to our marital expert, Charlie Munger.

590, What do you believe are the greatest successes of capitalism?,"Of the clear successes of capitalism, a greater abundance of things we want and need, and considerable improvements in the standard of living are good candidates. The standard of living in the U.S. has increased almost seven fold in the last century. One century is a speck on the greater timeline, and such an increase in productivity in the standard of living is surely unprecedented. Another noteworthy success of capitalism is that it is surely better than any alternative system at allocating resources and getting the best people to their most appropriate places. Consider this: in 1790, the first global census was conducted; there were 290m people in China, 100m in Europe, and 4m in what is now the U.S. Now the U.S. holds 4.5% of the world's population but is responsible for 30% of global GDP. I believe the great American book is yet to be written and will be the one that manages to capture how spectacular this growth has been; again 214 years is just an instant. When we think about such growth, I don't believe the causal factors are the people; it must be the system. The smartest people in Guam are as smart as the smartest people in Iceland are as smart as the smartest people in the U.S. Being born in the U.S. is more important to my success than anything that has happened since.",1
591, What do you see as the shortcomings of capitalism?,"Capitalism, like any system, is imperfect, but it's getting better and we're getting closer to goals such as equality of opportunity and learning how to deal with those that are hurt by the system. But capitalism is surely a free marketplace, a dog-eat-dog marketplace in many ways. And a marketplace implies losers. Early in my career, I bought a textile mill in New Bedford and the vast majority of the mill workers were Portuguese and could not speak any English. Over time, textile mills in other parts of the world were able to operate more efficiently and we simply could not compete. I had to shut the plant down and fire everyone; the workers were casualties of the system. You can't retrain or save those people; they'd had it. So the real challenge with capitalism is that you can't throw sand in the gears of greater output but you also want to care for the casualties. If you look around, it's clear that most people are burdened with real fear; fear is terrible and people shouldn't have to live with it. We should want to reduce societal fear of the things that they should never have to worry about - fear of going hungry, fear of going without medical care. These are the problems you should be thinking about solving.",1
592," How should we take care of those who are harmed by the system, like your former textile mill workers?","I would start with the tax system. It would not be easy to implement, but some form of a steeply progressive consumption tax for the wealthy makes a lot of sense to me. For instance, when I fly my private jet I use hundreds of gallons of jet fuel but I'm not taxed at a higher rate. Flying in a private jet is usually unnecessary, excessive consumption and I should be taxed appropriately via a higher consumption tax. Here's another example: I could easily hire 20,000 people and pay them $50,000 per year to sit here and paint portraits of me all day in search of the perfect o­ne. Not o­nly would that be ridiculous, but it would pull 20,000 productive contributors out of system and I should pay highly for that. Other than figuring out ways of reallocating money to the 'bottom 20%,' we need to focus o­n finding ways to help people be useful and feel useful. This means finding people jobs, keeping them involved in society, and the like.",1
593," With the recent changes in the global political economy and surges in terrorist activity, some would argue that uncertainty is increasing for all types of global markets. Where do you think things are heading and how should we deal with this heightened uncertainty?","Human beings don't change very much over time. But until recently, most dangerous people had limited ability to harm others in scale…. I think the terrorism issue is one problem to which there is clearly no solution. I'm confident that we'll solve everything else out - we making progress o­n cures for major diseases and all that - but terrorism, it seems to me, is impossible to solve because there will always be troubled people seeking to do harm to large masses of people. The intent is surely there. And knowledge of how to inflict terror is spreading. If you have intent and knowledge, the third aspect of terrorism is 'materials and deliverability.' This is harder to come by for the terrorists and what we should be working to prevent. If I knew we could devise a solution to terrorism, I would dedicate 100% of my foundation's funds to this effort; but I'm just not sure there's a solution.",1
594, What kind of impact will the demographic shift (i.e. baby boomers) have on the United States?,"We aren't big on demographic trends. It's difficult to translate that information into profitable decisions. It is hard to figure out what businesses will prosper in the future, based on macro trends. See's candy is for anyone and Fruit of the Loom is for people who need underwear today. We want to be right on something that will work right now, not something that might work in the future. I doubt that Wal-Mart spends a lot of time on demographics. They instead focus on where to put the store and what to put on the shelves. I've never found those kinds of stats useful. People were all excited to go into stocks 6 years ago, but it wasn't because of demographic trends.Warren then referred to a recent WSJ article written by Jeremy Siegel that discussed funds flowing out of investments because baby boomers will need to cash in their investments during retirement. He said he respected Siegel, but he doesn't find fund flows data useful.",1
595," Do you believe that the Federal Reserve is fostering moral hazard thereby leading to the misallocation of capital and subsequent asset bubbles? If so, what are the long term risks?","There is always some introduction of moral hazard when government decides to act in favor of the common good versus letting someone fail. There was moral hazard with the bailout of LTCM and there is some aspect of that with the current situation. But it’s hard to measure because the consequences are 15-20 years out. During the 1987 market crash, Greenspan was new to the job and unsure of what would happen. The specialist system got hit, most of them operated on very little capital and were broke. The Fed provided them with more capital. Will that change future behavior? Maybe, but at the time it was the right call. It’s also resulted in the “Too Big to Fail” doctrine. The big banks, Freddie Mac, and Fannie Mae figured the US Government wouldn’t allow them to fail and the managements of those companies knew that. I would be disinclined to second guess the Fed, they have more information and are trying to do what’s right.",1
596, Could you comment on the current rise of sovereign wealth funds from theMiddle East and Asia and how they are playing an increasing role in how corporations raise capital. Is competition from these sources for the cash flows of corporations affecting your investment strategies or opportunities?,"Any competition is competition. The situation of sovereign wealth funds is interesting. A lot of it is China bashing, OPEC bashing and plays right into politician’s hands. Today, the US will buy $2 billion more from the world than they buy from us. In exchange we give them little pieces of paper and they have to buy assets. As long as we consume more than we produce we have to let the rest of the world invest in us. We created sovereign wealth funds and that $2 billion gains interest. US funds feel they can get the best terms from these foreign investors and lately, enticed them into buying equity. China wanted to buy Unocal, a 3rd rate oil producer with production overseas in places like India. US Congress went ape and 395 representatives signed an anti-Chinese resolution to block the deal. For 100 years the US companies went around buying the world’s assets and bribing officials, but told China they couldn’t buy Unocal. The Chinese took it, but they didn’t like it. It doesn’t make sense that we are buying foreign assets, and giving them pieces of paper and then telling them what they can’t do with that money. We have created them and I have no objection to them. I recommend an index fund for these sovereign wealth funds. It gives them exposure to the US market, but they won’t get taken by salespeople with bad deals. In economics you always want to say “And then what?”",1
597, It seems that the worldwide trend is towards lower corporate tax rates. Do you think that the US risks becoming less competitive if it maintains its current corporate tax rate?,"Relative to GDP, government taxation is 18.5% and spending is 20%, so we borrow the balance. The national debt should not be a scary topic and the fact that it’s gone up is fine as long as it’s proportional to GDP. Where do we get that 18.5%? There’s 2.7 trillion in government revenues. 2.2 trillion comes from individuals, and less than 1% of that comes from the estate tax. 1.1 trillion comes from income taxes, with payroll taxes consisting of 900 billion, but it’s capped at the first $100,000 of salary. We want a tax system that encourages greater prosperity, but it needs to take care of the family.We did an informal office survey by looking at the total tax footprint versus the total income. I earned 46 million and paid a tax rate of 17.5%. My rate was the lowest, the average was 33%, and my cleaning lady paid 40%. The system is tilted towards the rich. The Forbes 400 total net worth has gone from 220 billion to 1.54 trillion, an increase of 7-to-1. You see in legislature that there is lobbying carried on by the powerful over issues such as the estate tax and carried interest for private equity investments. We need to flatten income and payroll taxes, and those making under $30,000 shouldn’t be bothered.Let’s imagine that 24 hours before you are born, a genie comes to you and tells you devise a social and economic system. The only catch is that after you designed the system, you would choose a paper from a barrel which would determine your demographics. What objectives would you want? You need to devise a system that creates prosperity. It needs to be a meritocracy, to put the right people in the right place. It needs to have a strong education system, and throw off lots of goods and services. It also needs to not discriminate against women or minorities. Even though the per capita GDP is $47,000, 20% of the population makes less than $20,000. We need to eliminate that fear of sickness or old age. A tax code is the codification of a country’s values. But you can’t kill the golden goose of prosperity.",1

599, Do you feel that the might of America has changed?,"You can bet against the dollar, but I would never bet against America. The system in the U.S. has allowed the country to unleash more for the world than any other country. Since 1776, the U.S. had a different system than the rest of the world and that system unleashed the human potential. We were not the smartest nor did we have the best resources. This is the same system we have in place today with people of similar intelligence. I have and would bet against the U.S. currency, stocks, etc. but the United States prevails over time. There are all kinds of rocky roads but we have rule of law, equality of opportunity, and a meritocracy. We have a market system and people apply energies and imagination to come up with things someone would want. Everyone in this room is working far below his/her potential.--------------------------------------------------Overall, I’m an enormous bull on the United States. In 1790, we had a population of 3.9 million people vs. 290 million in China and 190 million in Europe. We’ve all had roughly the same conditions since then, yet 215 years later, we have 30% of the world’s GDP. This is one of the great all-time success stories.I don’t feel that way. You’ll know who’s right in 20 or 30 years.What we do is no secret. The relative importance of America will diminish. The rest of the world is catching on and adopting our best practices. But our castle will grow. It’s good for us if the rest of the world does well, and they’re growing from a lower base. I don’t think their success comes out of our hide.",1
600, What are the biggest challenges that this country faces?,"The biggest problem is probably weapons of mass destruction. We have always had people who were ill-fitted to society and wished harm on others. In 1945 we unlocked the atom, and that changed everything. The human animal hasn’t changed, you still have the same percentage that are maladjusted. The problem is knowledge, materials, and deliverability. What you could do with the wrong kind of infectious disease is incredible. You can transmit things much faster today. Governments, individuals and organizations can’t control security. It’s what I would spend all of my money on if I could fix it. Everyone here in this room won what I call the ovarian lottery. You were born at the right time and we were all very, very lucky. We are in the luckiest 1% of humanity.",1
601, What do you think about the U.S. trade deficit?,"I talked to Barack back in August, and said: “I have good news and bad news. The good news is that the economy will be terrible, so you’ll definitely get elected. The bad news is that the economy will be even worse at inauguration.” He asked, “Do you think it’s too late to throw the election?” The trade situation is there and it causes problem and could exacerbate the situation. However, all issues go on the back burner until we solve the big problem. We create sovereign wealth funds, buying more goods and services than everyone else in the world. The decline in the oil price has helped the trade deficit but nothing will get better until everyone feels better. Every day, we buy $2 billion of goods and service more than we produce and export. We give the exporting nations USD. The trade deficit creates claims on the United States. Sometimes we’re a little hypocritical. For example, three years ago, the Chinese wanted to buy Unocal (a small oil company in California) and Congress wanted to condemn China for wanting to buy the oil company with the money we gave them (through U.S. imports). That’s a little disingenuous. The trade deficit creates a situation because we give people claim checks, then we get upset when they want to use them. The Japanese bought Rockefeller Center in the 80’s. Did we think they were going to move it? It’s not useful to fan those flames in a nuclear world, and that’s what’s wrong with “Buy America.” The trade deficit will come up big time when we get past the current problems.",1
602," What level of taxation on capital gains is most conducive to the long-term economic health of this society, and is that also the fair and just rate?",".  I think there's an easy answer to your capital gains issue, and one is what makes an economy work best in some abstract mathematical sense, and the other is the consideration that you allude to that gets into issues of fairness. Aristotle felt that systems worked better when they were generally perceived as fair, and civilization worked better if people saw the differences in rewards as being reasonably fair, anyway. I think that if you have a civilization where you work 90 hours a week driving a taxicab, with no money and no medical insurance and so forth, and somebody else does nothing but own Berkshire Hathaway shares and sit on the country club porch and peel off a few every year to pay the bills, that would be regarded as so unfair, that even if it had some theoretical economic efficiency that it would be counterproductive for our particular civilization to have that kind of a tax code. I'm all for having some taxation of capital gains. Once you reach that conclusion, you get into the question of what is the fair rate. I think the fair rate might be a little lower than it is now, but not much lower.Sounds to me like he's a seller of Berkshire. (laughter) Patrick the questioner, who Buffett knew previously--ed. gave me a system of mental construct to attack questions like this. He said just imagine that you were going to be born 24 hours from now, and you had been granted this extraordinary power: You were given the right to determine the economic rules of the society that you were going to enter. Those rules were going to prevail for your lifetime, and your children's lifetime, and your grandchildren's lifetime. But as in most of these types of questions, there's one hooker: You don't know whether you're going to be born black or white, male or female, bright or retarded, infirm or able-bodied, in the United States or Afghanistan--in other words you're going to participate in 24 hours in what I call the ovarian lottery. (laughter) It's the most important event in which you'll ever participate. It's going to determine way more than what school you go to, how hard you work, all kinds of things. You're going to get one ball drawn out of a barrel that probably contains 5.7 billion balls now. And that's you. Now what kind of society are you going to construct with that in prospect?Well I suspect you would focus on two issues that Patrick mentioned in his question. You would try to figure out a system that is going to produce an abundant amount of goods, and where that abundance is going to increase at a rapid rate during your lifetime and your children's and your grandchildren's. You'd want some system that turned out what people wanted and needed, and you'd want something that would turn them out in increasing quantities for as far as the eye could see. But you'd also want a system that, while it did that, treated the people that did not win the ovarian lottery in a way that you would want to be treated if you were in their position, because a lot of people don't win the lottery. I mean, Charlie--when we born the odds were over 30 to 1 against being born in the United States. Just winning that portion of the lottery is an enormous plus. We wouldn't be worth a damn in Afghanistan. We'd be giving talks and nobody would be listening. (laughter) It would be the worst of all worlds. So we won in that way--we won partially in the era in which we were born by being born male. When I was growing up, women could be teachers and secretaries and nurses and that was about it. 50% of the count of the country was excluded from a very large part of the occupations. We won it by being white. No tribute to us, it just happened that way. And we won it in another way by being wired in a certain way which we had nothing to do with, that happens to enable us to be good at valuing businesses. Is that the greatest talent in the world? No, it just happens to be something that pays off like crazy in this system. (laughter)When you get through with that, you still want to have a system where the people that are born like Bill Gates or Andy Grove or something get to turn those talents to work in a way that really maximizes those talents. It would be a crime to have people like that or Tom Murphy working in some pedestrian occupation just because you have this great egalitarian instinct. The trick, it seems to me, is to have some balance that causes the people who have the talents that can produce goods that people want in a market society to turn them out in great quantity, and to keep wanting to do it all their lives, and at the same time, takes the people that lost the lottery, and makes sure that just because they got the wrong ticket, they don't live a life that's dramatically worse than people that were luckier.When I get through that long speech, I probably come out with the idea that the capital gains tax as it is today is just about right. I've been around a lot of people with money and talent over time, they don't always go together but I've been around both classes (laughter) and I see very few of them that are turned off from using their talents by a 28% capital gains tax--it just doesn't happen. They do what they like to do. I've just never seen it happen. I see a lot of people that pay taxes that are higher than 28% that are contributing more to society by some judgment other than a pure market system. I just don't think it's inappropriate in a country like this to tax me at 28% for selling some of my Berkshire shares whereas somebody who makes even relatively modest amounts of money can get up to 39% while they're trying to figure out a cure for cancer. That's where I come out on that. (applause)",1

604, What's your opinion of oil? peak oil?,"Oil is finite. It will eventually run out for practical purposes. America found oil early, and there isn’t much left here. We will see a plug‐in electric car. BYD is very smart. Doesn’t know if change to alternatives will be evolutionary or revolutionary. But oil will be higher and solar/electric will be more abundant. (A side note: Buffett went from average oil out of the ground down the value chain and into a personal consumption calculation in his head in about ten seconds.)----------------------------------------------------Q - Oil will run out this century. Considering US policy is to do nothing until the last second, will we face World War III? Will oil companies go to zero?. Oil won’t run out - it doesn’t work that way. At some point the daily productive capacity will level off and then start declining gradually. There is the depletion aspect and the decline curves. We are producing 86 million barrels per day or so, more than ever produced. We are closer, by my calculations, to almost our productive capacity, than we have ever been. I think our surplus capacity is less, and quite a bit less, than in the past. Whatever that peak is, whether it’s 5 years, 10 years, etc., the world will adjust, and we will think about it. Adjustments will cause demand to taper off. I don’t know how much oil is there, but there are lots of barrels of oil in place. We never recover total potential. We may have better engineering recovery in the future. It is nothing like an on and off switch. You may still have enormous political considerations to get access to available oil since it is so important. There is nothing you can do over a short period of time to wean the world off oil. He’s always pulling that one on me too. laughter",1

606, The current tenuous economic situation and interest rates? Where are we going?,"I don’t think about the macro stuff. What you really want to in investments is figure out what is important and knowable. If it is unimportant and unknowable, you forget about it. What you talk about is important but, in my view, it is not knowable. Understanding Coca-Cola is knowable or Wrigley’s or Eastman Kodak. You can understand those businesses that are knowable. Whether it turns out to be important depends where your valuation leads you and the firm’s price and all that. But we have never not bought or bought a business because of any Macro feeling of any kind because it doesn’t make any difference. Let’s say in 1972 when we bought See’s Candy, I think Nixon put on the price controls a little bit later, but so what! We would have missed a chance to buy something for $25 million that is producing $60 million pre-tax now. We don’t want to pass up the chance to do something intelligent because of some prediction about something we are no good on anyway. So we don’t read or listen to in relation to macro factors at all. The typical investment counselor organization goes out and they bring out their economist and they trot him out and he gives you this big macro picture. And they start working from there on down. In our view that is nonsense.If Alan Greenspan was on the one side of me and Robert Rubin on the other side and they both were whispering in my ear exactly what they were going to do the next twelve months, it wouldn’t make any difference to me what I would pay for Executive Jet or General Re or anything else I do.---------------------------------------------------Q - your opinion on low interest rates?. Very difficult for many with such low rates. People talk about easy money, but it’s not easy on the people who have money. If you invested at these rates when Columbus landed, and didn’t pay taxes, you’d have doubled your money by now! It won’t go on forever, but I’m very sympathetic with people living on a fixed income. Purchasing power is getting eaten away. This will end at some point. I would not want to be Chairman of the Fed. It won’t work forever to run big budget deficits and have easy monetary policy. When we run into trouble the blame doesn’t go to the Fed, it goes to Congress. The pressure of extremely low rates can’t be underestimated. Afraid of everything else, pressure to put other prices back up will be enormous as fear gets resolved. You shouldn’t underestimate the degree to which the last year of stock prices is result of agony of very low interest rates. We have seen a lot of that, and we’ll see what happens when rates go up.",1

608, What was the impact of September 11th?,"It made everyone realize that human haven't progressed in how they behave, but have progressed in terms of their ability to hurt someone they hate. 9/11 brought that home. It used to be that if you hated someone, you could only throw a rock at them.There are millions of people who hate us, but most can't do anything about it. But a few can, and there's incredibly more ability for a deranged person to do harm to us today.Before 9/11, we weren't being paid for insuring the risk of terrorist attacks. Since then, the insurance industry has recognized that it has exposures that it had to exclude or charge for.For new policies, we've sold quite a bit of terrorism polities, but almost all exclude NCB -- nuclear (and fires afterward), chemical and biological. The World Trade Center attack was about as extreme as you can get without NCB.As an industry, we can pay claims of tens of billions of dollars, but not hundreds of billions.We write a few policies that cover NCB because we can take a loss of a few billion.Most people don't realize that the World Trade Center attack was, by a huge margin, the largest workman's comp loss in history. Had the attack been on, say, Yankee Stadium, there would have been few workman's comp claims, but people were at work in the World Trade Centers. Imagine if someone developed a deadly biological agent and released it into the ventilation systems of a number of large buildings simultaneously. It would make the workman's comp claims for the World Trade Center look like nothing.The key to both investing and insurance underwriting is to be realistic and disciplined. 9/11 drove home these lessons.",1

610, Could you use your clout to advocate for tort reform?,"I'm sympathetic to what you're saying, but our clout is nothing compared to that of trial lawyers. It's appalling the friction costs to our society of tort insurance. People pay off rather than go through the nuisance of a suit. The people that pursue that activity pursue it not because it's right, but profitable.But when I look at what's happened in Corporate America, I don't think they should get off scot-free. I just wish the people who engaged in the wrong-doing would pay, not the D&O insurance.Would you make people who did wrong things pay a portion themselves?",1

612, Views on growing income inequality?,"The American consumer overall is better off, but not dramatically better than 10 years ago. You're right that there's been increasing inequality. We don't make decisions on what business we buy based on some sweeping projections about what American consumers will do. We're very certain that Americans will do better over time. Average income per capita rose 7x in the 20th century. A simple phone call across the country used to cost a great deal relative to income. People will be better off decade after decade. We're not big on being futurologists.Our consumer businesses -- candy, furniture, etc. -- are very very soft. They were down in Q1. I think we've been in a recession -- although not huge or violent one -- for two years. When government talks about GDP growing 2%, keep in mind that the population grows 1%. It's GDP per capita that counts. And GDP counts people who make you take off your shoes before you get on a plane. It counts good and services that we wish we didn't want. When you get into a war, if you drop planes into the ocean, it building replacement planes is part of GDP. Desirable GDP, my guess, has gone no place in the past three years. The quality of GDP isn't talked about very much.BRK2004 - I don’t see how corporate profits will move up as percentage of GDP.---------------------------------------------------. Corporate profits today are close to their highs, except for a few years after World War II. Incidentally, corporate taxes are nowhere near their highs, so there’s a disconnect there.It is certainly true that in the last 5 to 10 years, the disparity in income has widened significantly and the tax breaks for the wealthy have been extraordinary. I’ve said in the past that most of the members of the Forbes 400, myself included, pay a lower percentage of their income in taxes than their receptionist. This wasn’t true decades ago and it’s wrong in a rich society.In 2004, my tax rate was the lowest of the 15 people in my office – and I’m not taking advantage of any tax shelters – and it’s even lower in 2005. That’s crazy. I don’t think the American people understand that, and if they did, they wouldn’t be very happy about it. GDP per capita figures have been very good. I wouldn’t get too wild about the median income. There are huge fluctuations up and down. What’s really important is that the pie keeps growing.That being said, I don’t disagree that Warren’s right about too many tax cuts for the wealthy, but I don’t think it’s as important.",1

The great problem of mankind is that the genie is out of the bottle on nuclear weapons. More and more people will know how to do damage. Psychotics will wish ill will. Materials and deliverability is the choke point. People generally associate this risk with terrorists and rogue states. But I regard it as a big threat to the future of mankind. We haven’t made much progress and we should be doing everything to reduce access to materials. We have a proposal to reduce the rationale to have big weapons. The world has 6.5 billion people, and it is very likely that twice the number of people wish ill than when the world had 3 billion. We used to just pick up a stone and throw it at our neighbor, so massive damage was limited. Since 1945, everything in the world has changed except how men think. There’s been exponential growth, and we haven’t gotten rid of the nuts. We live in a dangerous world, and it’s getting more dangerous as we go along. In the Cuban Missile Crisis, the odds were probably 50/50. We were lucky. It won’t go away. You would hope we have an administration which will try to figure out how to minimize the risk.

614, Thoughts about the odds of a nuclear attack?,"You are quite correct that people tend to underestimate low probability events when they haven’t happened recently, and overestimate them when they have.On the nuclear question, you can do the math easily – the question is whether your assumptions are right. If there’s a 10% chance each year of an attack, then there’s only a 0.5% chance it doesn’t happen sometime in the next 50 years. But if the odds are only 1% each year, then there’s a 60% chance you get through the next 50 years.---------------------------------------------------. I couldn’t agree more that the ultimate problem of mankind is a state- sponsored use of a nuclear weapon. It will happen someday.Thousands of years ago, if you wished evil upon your neighbor, you threw a rock, but since 1945, the potential for inflicting enormous harm on a large number of people has increased geometrically.To those who believe the idea that if we solve poverty it will take care of the problem, I’d remind you that the only country to use nuclear weapons on another is us.What holds the danger in check is a lack of knowledge, materials and deliverability. But knowledge is getting more widespread, and materials are too.I don’t know how money attacks this, but I think this should be a top priority, at least for my foundation.There are six billion people and a few percent are really crazy and they would like to do great harm to a lot of people. And only one has to succeed. I don’t know how many we’ve stopped. It could be state-sponsored or by a terrorist.As for how our company and stock would do, Berkshire is better positioned than anyone else, but that won’t make much difference.

618, Opinion on public education?,"A good public school system is a lot like virginity: easy to preserve, but not to restore. To succeed, well-to-do people need to be involved. I admire the fact that people like John Walton, Bill Gates and Ted Forstmann have gotten involved with this issue.Next to the nuclear/chemical/biological weapon problem, the #1 problem we face is making sure our educational system is providing a good education to all children – and it’s not. Dealing with the problem is complicated, as there are thousands of school districts and many unions as well.A big problem is that in many places, the rich have opted out. I imagine that if I used the local golf courses, I’d care a lot about how they were managed and maintained – it’s the same with schools. There’s a two-tiered system right now.I’m a big believer in public schools.Bill Ruane of Ruane, Cunniff, managers of the Sequoia Fund has an extraordinary program that teaches kids to read. It’s been going on for 10 years and the kids are enthusiastic.A major reason for the success of the United States is the equality of opportunities compared to the rest of the world. It’s a bad situation when some kids have great families, caring teachers, good schools, etc., but less advantaged kids have teachers that just push their students through the system, in schools where other students are doing bad things.This failure of the educational system shouldn’t be allowed in a country with almost $40,000 of GDP per capita.",1

620, Views on the U.S. Current Account Deficit?,"We have earned more on American assets owned by people outside this country than the reverse. The net balance flipped in the most recent quarter and I expect this to continue. One reason is that the foreigners owning our Treasury bonds were getting only a little over 1% not long ago, so this was leading to a favorable balance. Now, that’s turning as our interest rates are up. And, over time, it’s going against us.Now if you consider the magnitude and consequences of our $3 trillion net debtor position, that depends on what the dollar does. Over the past few weeks, the dollar has weakened, which reduces our debt, but could lead to inflation. Overall, these trends will not be favorable. I agree. This is the country that could sustain fiscally irresponsible policies for a long time. We still think this is the best place to be. But I also think there’s a chance for something to suddenly go wrong.",1

622, What do you think the likelihood is of a major credit contraction?,"It occurred during the junk bond crisis in 2002 and for equities in 1974. I don’t think you’ll necessarily see a contraction of credit or the Fed stepping on the brakes. I think you might see an exogenous event, a shock to the system, that causes a huge widening of credit spreads and a cheapening of equities. This would be good for Berkshire because we have money to take advantage of this.In the past, when credit contracted, there was no money around. We tried to buy a bank in Chicago 30 or 40 years ago and couldn’t borrow at all. The only people willing to lend to us were in Kuwait, and would only lend in dinars. That was real credit contraction. The reason the Fed was established was in response to this. We really needed a system where that would not happen. I think the Fed will not by design produce any credit contraction. Jon Alter, in his book about the Great Depression The Defining Moment: FDR’s Hundred Days and the Triumph of Hope, describes how this country was close to the brink and FDR got any law passed he wanted, as soon as he could write them. It was a good thing in this case – banks were closing and people were dealing in scrip.In 1998, Long Term Capital Management blew up and you had a seize-up of the credit markets that was not orchestrated by the Fed. People panicked about even the safest instruments. This happened not 100 years ago but less than 10 years ago. There were plenty of smart people with a lot of money, but people panicked in part because they saw others panicking.History doesn’t repeat itself, but it rhymes. We’ll have something that rhymes.",1
623, The state of Florida getting into the insurance business?,"It’s easy to understand both sides. The average homeowner will not read line by line of an insurance policy and the agent often won’t explain it. So when something goes wrong, the homeowner wants to be paid. It’s worse when tens of thousands of homeowners are affected at the same time. It’s natural for government to step in and expand what an insurance company thought they were covering, which leads insurance companies to pull out.I can understand the insurance company not wanting to write policies if the words won’t be adhered to, and I can understand the upset homeowner. If I were writing policies, I’d put exclusions in big type, but even so, I’d expect courts and legislatures to extend or even abrogate the terms of the contracts, figuring a guy like me or insurance companies can better afford it vs. the people affected.When you have people around the country subsidize people who suffer from hurricanes in Florida, that gets very tough. It might become so expensive that they want to socialize it, but the guy in Nebraska says “Why should I subsidize you living in a hurricane path?”It will really become an issue if you have a $100 or $150 billion loss in Florida. This would lead to a huge increase in taxation in Florida, so the state might call on Washington the federal government to pay for it. How much should people who are not exposed to risk send to people who choose to have this risk? I think you’ll see a big struggle over this in the next 10 years.I can’t tell you with precision what the Florida legislation says, but the state of Florida has gotten more into the business of insuring citizens than it was before.Buffett asked Joe Brandon, CEO of Gen Re, to take the microphone and answer the question.Brandon: Back in mid-January, the Florida legislature met in a special session and passed legislation that is moving a lot of risk in personal lines. It is having a depressing effect on the insurance industry. There is no free lunch. The state and citizens of Florida are taking a lot of risk. It will work out well if the wind doesn’t blow, but odds are that it will. According to this summary of the legislation, the state has taken on a $12 billion increase in exposure from $16 billion to $28 billion, with the possibility of an additional $4 billion more.. The real problem will be with a $100 billion insured loss. The state might have to issue $60 billion in bonds and might go to the federal government and say, “It’s not our fault and the entire country should pay.” $100 billion isn’t likely – Hurricane Andrew, inflation adjusted, was $30 billion – but if that storm had come through 20 miles north, it could have been. If this happens, we’ll find out if the whole country has, in effect, been insuring Florida. If the federal government throws it back to Florida, they’d have to issue a lot of bonds and raise taxes.",1

625, What's your opinion on global warming? climate change?,"I believe the odds are good that global warming is serious. There’s enough evidence that it would be foolish to say there’s a 99% chance it isn’t a problem. In this case, you have to build the ark before the rains come. If you have to make a mistake, err on the side of the planet. Build a margin of safety to take care of the only planet we have.Gen Re writes way less business subject to the effects of global warming than does National Indemnity, which writes super-cat policies. We think much more about whether global warming will produce atmospheric changes that will change the frequency and intensity of major storms. We think the exposure goes up every year, even though we don’t know exactly what goes on in the atmosphere.The relationship is explosive – global warming could increase expected losses by two, three, four or five times. It’s not something that keeps me up in terms of the financial prospects of Berkshire, but it’s worth thinking about. We do know that in 2004 and 2005, hurricanes hit with a frequency and intensity that would not be expected looking at the past century. We were spared a far worse scenario by a couple of category 5 hurricanes that didn’t hit the coastline.I don’t think Katrina is the worst that we’ll see. I don’t know all of the factors that go into hurricanes – there could be 50 variables, but all I know is that it’s likely to get worse. And it would be crazy to write insurance at prices from a few years ago, so it’s a factor for us.",1

Famous line from Bill Buckley about what would you do if elected? ‘I would demand a recount.’ The truth is that you get lots of pandering in the policies that are proposed. The candidates are pretty smart about economics. The political process is something that doesn’t lend itself to Douglas-Lincoln debates on the fine points. I think the current candidates will be better in office than on a soap box. We have a country that works well regardless of who is in office. You want to buy stock in a business that is so good because sooner or later an idiot will run it. I think we have three very good candidates. The motivations of people running are better than their proclamations. You may win a badge for courage, but you won’t win the presidency in Iowa if you’re against ethanol. I would gladly pay to have this job. Let’s assume I was campaigning for this job, and if so, my answers might be different. It is a corrupting process, naturally. There is a boom in oil and also in soybeans. Because of increases in food prices, would anyone expect to propose an excess profits tax on farmers? But what about an excess profits tax on Exxon? Situational ethics and policymaking depend a lot on voters. I’m not sure I’d be able to do better, but if I wanted to be President, I’m not sure my behavior wouldn’t be bad too.

It’s worth more now than 20 years ago—something good has happened. The propensity to save seems innate in some places. If you own Berkshire, you are saving because we retain earnings and therefore you are net saving—and I have been doing it in Berkshire for 43 years. I don’t know that the savings rate—based on calculations on consumption and imports—is accurate. We are importing $700 billion more of services than we are exporting per year. We are exporting claims against America. But we are so rich, it may not be really apparent. Average standards are likely to improve, but it may be disproportionate. In net real terms, the value on a per capita basis will very likely increase decade to decade. But it is nothing compared to China or Korea where the savings rate is very high. We may not save very much because we don’t need to. We are a very rich country, and we may not need to save as much as other countries trying to reach their potential.",1

636, Is there a chance the CDS \[Credit Default Swap\] market may eclipse subprime?,"The CDS notional value is about $60 trillion. There is lots of double counting, etc, but no doubt it is a lot of money. They are swaps, or insurance against companies going bankrupt. We have written two types of derivatives, and we have insured a swap that pays to someone else in the event of a default on high yield indices. I think we will make significant money. I think there is no question that the corporate default rate will rise. That has been included in the price in writing this insurance. Will the CDS market lead to chaos? Probably not, but if Bear Stearns had failed, you would have had chaotic conditions. A CDS is a payment by one party to another. When someone loses money on a loan, they’ve lost real money, but there is not a swap of dollars immediately when the loan goes bad. In a CDS, there is an exchange of cash. Whether the counterparties fail on a massive scale—I don’t think it will happen. We’ve had enormous collateral payments from one firm to another in this recent crisis. Fairfax Financial made $1 billion in CDS’s. This means another guy lost $1 billion. They have been the most volatile of instruments and it really hasn’t created a problem in the system. If the Fed must step in, I don’t think it will be due to CDS’s. It may cause big losses, but it will be matched by big gains by others. There is a problem of an overnight disruption in the system i.e. Bear, nuclear bomb—where discontinuity and collateral posings are inadequate. At that time, large CDS exposure could exacerbate chaos to a considerable degree. Charlie 1 point, Invisible Hand 0 points.",1

660,"So I&#8217;m excited to speak to you. I very vividly remember when you can be a stock market genius came out in the late 90s and exploded, it was sort of out of left field at least to me and just was suddenly a really, really big book, but let&#8217;s go back and start early.
So I have to ask the question from &#8220;You Can Be A Stock Market Genius,&#8221; what did going to the dog track teach you about investing?","Well I wrote up in the book that you know, the only place when I was younger, I kind of like gambling, and the only place that would let us sneak in was the dog track when I was on vacation in Florida and so I used to sneak in with my cousin and we got to place bets and have a good time and you know half the fun was sneaking in.
But we figured we really had the whole dog track thing nailed when we found a dog that had run its last race in 32 seconds and all the other dogs had run it in 44 seconds and we thought wow you know we really have a great dog; we need to bet on this thing.",0
661,What where the odds?,"We had you know very high odds, it was close to 99 to 1, I think, which I think is a size that they let it go and so we thought we to clean up and of course, we lost, you know that dog had been running a shorter race that's why it only ran 32 seconds and so you sort of really have to know something when you're betting and then the same thing for investing, you know, if you don't know what you're doing, it's an, you know as they say, an expensive place to find out.
So the dog track, I think, was a nice lesson, losing you know $2 or $4 is a very cheap lesson for us.",0
662,"So you go to school at Wharton both undergrad and graduate, how did you find your way to Wall Street? What was your first job like?","Well I got a summer job on Wall Street first with Kidder Peabody in their research department and to tell you how long ago it was, we were adjusting financial statements for inflation, which doesn't &#8212; probably wouldn’t be a big seller right now.",0
663,"For the younger listeners, tell us what is this inflation you speak of?","Well you know when you hold your dollars and it buys less and less each year, but less and less was like 6 percent or 8 percent, not you know half a percent or 1 percent of what we've become used to in the last 10 years or so.",0
664,And what led you from research into the art of stock picking?,"Well, junior year, I read an article actually in Forbes Magazine about Ben Graham's stock picking formula, and it was really what they used to call net-net or stock selling below their liquidation value and it seems very simple to me because I was at Wharton at the time and they were learning efficient market theory and none of it resonated with me.
I was kind of like I said interested in gambling or at least speculating or figuring things out and then taking a calculated gamble and what they were telling me was don't try, there were saying that no one can beat the market and the stock prices are efficient and just through simple observation looking at the newspaper and they used to have the 52-week high low prices in the newspaper, it seemed unreasonable that you know the fair price was 51 day and eight months later, it was 120, and that was pretty much every stock had that kind of range every year and it didn't make sense to me that the fundamentals of the underlying businesses were actually changing that much.
And so when I read Ben Graham, sort of a light bulb went off just this little article and I started reading everything I could about what he had written, both security analysis and the intelligent investor, and eventually led my way to Warren Buffett and you know, sort of the rest is history, it's a very good age, you know I was younger than 21 at the time you know junior year of college to recognize that this was what I was going to be doing the rest my life.",0
665,"So let&#8217;s talk a little about value investing since you mentioned Graham and Buffett. Value has had a pretty rough go over the past decade, very reminiscent of a similar period of rough performance in the 90s. For those of us with a value tilt in our portfolios, explain why this is a cyclical phenomenon and not the death of value investing.","Right, well my definition of value is figure out what the business is worth and pay a lot less. It is not low price-to-book, low price sales investing which if you took a look at MorningStar, you took a look at Russell and they analyze what we do, they don't put us in value as value investors, they put us in blend.
As Warren Buffett would say, value and growth are tied at the hip, growth is part of value, so the way that it's traditionally done you know now and categorized is not my definition of value. So what traditionally, when people characterize these things, low price-to-book, low price sales, those are things that have correlated well in the past with the higher return, cyclically, but over time, it tends to work, because let's say low price book, you know, something selling close to its book value, well that just means people are giving a very high value to the business itself, they're just sort of valuing it pretty close to the cost of the assets that were placed in the business and not giving much of a premium.
So you would tend to get more than your fair share of companies that are out-of-favor meaning because they are priced low, but if you are a private equity firm, trying to buy a business, you not buying it because it's trading close to its book value, you're looking at cash flows and trying to project what they are going to be in the future and what are you paying relative to that and what's it worth and it has nothing to do with low price-to-book, low price sales, it really has to do with the cash flow generating part of the business.
So, you know, it does not bother me that traditional value as defined by MorningStar, Russell, or whoever else defines it would sort of factor like attributes of individual stocks, has or has not worked.
I mean you know, here's the big thing, the way I describe this is, look, momentum has worked well for the last 30 to 40 years, not just in this country but across the globe with one or two exceptions. The reason we don't, we're not momentum investors, and there is no argument about it, there has, it's just that if it didn't work for the next two years, it could be that it is just cyclically out-of-favor like we're talking about and all we have to do is be patient and it works over the long term, you just have to be a patient investor.
Or it could be that it's you know not so hard to figure out a stock used to be down here and now it's up here and there's plenty of data and computers and ability to crunch numbers and plus plenty of research papers that say that momentum's worked over a period of 30-40 years and maybe if it doesn't work over the next two years, the trade has become crowded and it's degraded. And that's why didn't work over the next two years.
And two years from now, I wouldn’t know whether it's just cyclically out-of-favor or the trades degraded, so that's why I'm not a momentum investor. The reason I'm a value investor, according to our definition, is stocks are actually ownership shares of business that you value and try to buy at a discount, they're not pieces of paper the bounce around that you put Sharpe ratios and Sortina ratios and use computer simulations to balance your portfolios or whatever it is.
Basically, they are ownership shares of business that you value and try to buy at a discount so it's certainly possible that the market does not reward my valuations even if I'm right over the next two years but that doesn't mean we're going to stop doing what we're doing, that's what stocks are, ownership shares of businesses, and that's very fundamental to the way we look at everything. And if you actually look at it in that way, you can see all of modern portfolio theory and all the way most academics and many advisers and managers look at the world just seems kind of insane when you really boil it down to ownership shares of businesses that you're trying to value.
And then you can really sift through all the confusion that the very smart people have tried to put a lot of numbers on the investment business that don't make a lot of sense.",0
666,"That&#8217;s absolutely fascinating. Let&#8217;s talk a little bit about Gotham Capital, you start in 1985 with about $7 million, some of it coming from Michael Milken, how did that relationship began in and why was Milken interested in investing with you?","Well the simple story is that I had a friend at Wharton who was one of the first people who was in Michael Milken's group and I &#8212; I had been working at a hedge fund for about three years after graduating from Wharton and I had always wanted to go out on my own and I felt I was ready and I mentioned it to my friend and I said, gee if I could raise you know X dollars, I would go out on my own.
And my good friend gave me a call the next day and said Mike said fine.",0
667,Just like that. Done.,"Yeah so it wasn't quite as easy as that you know, I had to negotiate my terms in the was actually kind of a funny story because it was my life and he did, you know, I don’t know, at the time 20 to 30 deals a day, I have no idea but it was my life and I'm not a very good negotiator at all. But when I was in the room with him, I wanted the terms that I wanted, to run the money because it was going to be my life and I only had one to give and this was one of 30 deals.
And so I wouldn't give in and we sat in there for an hour while he kept Ronald Perelman waiting because he was about to buy Revlon, and you know I was just like a little tiny deal and I wouldn't give in because you know, like I said, I had a bottom line which is pretty rare for me,",0
668,And he didn’t let you walk?,"He negotiated like this was the biggest deal of his life even though I knew it was just, you know, something he did &#8212; you know, with dessert at lunch one day or something and he left the room and because I wouldn’t give in and he sent his brother in.",0
669,Right.,"And you know after half hour I got the terms I wanted from his brother and then when Mike got back, he was not very happy but that's how I got into the business and he was a good partner for me.",0
670,"That&#8217;s a great story so I have to share with our listeners your returns, you compound from 1985 to 1995 at 40 percent annually before fees &#8212;",50 percent annually before fees.,0
671,"40 percent annually after fees, no, it&#8217;s &#8212;","50, for those 10 years, it was 50 before fees.",0
672,"That&#8217;s astounding, that&#8217;s an incredible run of numbers so the first question is what&#8217;s the secret sauce, how you can &#8212; we all know the 80s and 90s were a boom time but it wasn&#8217;t 50 percent a year, what was the secret sauce for that sort of returns?","Well one of the ways to get those kind of returns is not to run a lot of money.
So after five years in business, we returned half for outside capital.",0
673,Back to investors.,Yes.,0
674,They must have been thrilled.,"Well, not thrilled, but after 10 years, returned all of it, that would make them really not thrilled, because and the other way is to be concentrated, so 6 to 8 ideas were usually 80 plus percent of our portfolio, so that portfolio management theory doesn't like that strategy very much.",0
675,"Right, not diversified, high risk, blah, blah, blah.","Right, well Warren Buffett has a good response to that as well. You know he says listen let's say you sold out your business and you got $1 million and you are living in town and you want to figure out something smart to do with it. So you analyze all the businesses in town and let's say there's hundreds of business and you stick to &#8212; if you find businesses where the managements really good, the prospects for the business are good, it's run well, they treat shareholders well, and you divide your million dollars between eight businesses that you researched well in town, no one would think that's imprudent, they would actually think that was pretty prudent.
But when you get to call them stocks and you get stock quotes daily on these pieces of paper that bounce around put people put numbers on it and volatility and all these other things where really it's not that meaningful, you know from one sense if you're investing in businesses and you did a lot of research and invested in eight different businesses with the proceeds of your sale, people would think you're a pretty prudent guy.
All of a sudden if you invested in stocks and did the same type of work, people think you're insane, and it's just an interesting analogy that I was think of when people make fun of me that I was that concentrating.",0
676,"You know the flip side of that is imagine if we got prints minute by minute for the valuation of our homes, people would lose their mind, they wouldn’t be able to manage it. So that understanding &#8212;","Well, imagine if you had a theory of buying homes, I'm going to buy the ones that went up the most last ready months or six months. I mean it's a really good analogy. I usually use the house analogy all when people asked me how do we go about in valuing stocks and people understand completely when they're buying a house, there are certain things you would do and we don't do any different than owning a business.",0
677,"That makes a lot of sense. So now let me tack to what you&#8217;re doing currently, so whereas you previously returned a bunch of money to investors and hedge funds and saying hey we don&#8217;t think there is &#8212; this can scale enough that we can keep generating these returns for you. Now you&#8217;re going the opposite direction and saying okay, we&#8217;re going to look for something that can scale.
So tell us a little bit about the Gotham Index Plus portfolio. We were talking earlier are off-line about passive versus active, this is a little bit of both.","Right, so we didn’t run outside money until again after we returned it all in '94, we ran our &#8212; we had been lucky enough to keep our staff and run our internal money but in &#8212;",0
678,And how long did you do that for?,"14 years and then in 2009, we started taking outside money again it was really you know really starts really back when I was in business school and I had read that article about Benjamin Graham and actually did a study with a couple of my classmates, Rich Pzena, who is a famous money manager now and Bruce Newberg who is still a good friend of mine, and we did some work on Ben Graham's formulas and we ended up doing a research paper and having it published in the Journal portfolio management back in about 1981, and had always been fascinated by that and over the years, we had really evolved more towards the way Warren Buffett invests, not just cheap, but cheap and good.
And I've been teaching at Columbia for a number of years, I have been doing that 22 years now, but you know that time in the early 2000s, I've been doing it for a bunch years in and we had been making money using the same principles that Buffett uses, you know buying cheap good businesses. And I wanted to prove that together with my partner Rob Goldstein, I wanted to prove that the what I've been teaching my students, what we had been using to make money worked very well just like we had shown that Ben Graham's simple methodology still works back in the 70s and early 80s.
I wanted to show that what we had evolved more into the Warren Buffett way of earning money worked and we want to prove it in the same way that we had written that paper about. So we hired a computer analyst that could help us you know mine through data and we came up with some very simple metrics for good, you know, what's a good business, and if you read through Buffett's letters, it's very clear, he is looking for businesses that earn high returns on tangible capital. And what that means is every business needs working capital, every business needs fixed assets, how well can it convert that working capital and fixed assets into earnings.
And in the book The Little Book That Beats The Market which I really wrote for my kids to understand this, I explained it this way, imagine you're building a store and you have to buy the land and build the store and set up the displays and stock it with inventory and all that cost of $400,000. And every year if the store earns $200,000, that's a 50 percent return on tangible capital, maybe I'll open some more stores.
Then I compared it to another store and I call that store Just Broccoli, it's not a very good idea just to sell Broccoli in your store, but you still have to buy the land, build the store, set up the display stock with inventory, still going to cost you roughly the $400,000 but because it's basically a stupid idea just to sell broccoli, maybe you will only earn $10,000, that is 2.5 percent return on tangible capital.
And so all we said was all things being equal much preferred to own the business that can reinvest its money at 50 percent returns than 2.5 percent returns.
So that was one metric. Good. That's what we looked at if you read through Buffett's letters, that's the first thing he's looking for.
The other metric we looked at is cheap you know in the analogy I would use as a house you know, it's $1 million house and one question you might ask is how much rent can I get for that thing?
And if you try to figure out whether that's a good deal or not and if you get $80,000 a year in rent that's an 8 percent yield in a two percent or three percent interest rate environment that today might look fairly attractive. So we sort of looked at how much cash is the business generating relative to the cost of buying the business, then we looked at whether it's a good business, when they have the money, what do they do with it? Okay?
So we came out with two crude metrics for good and cheap and you know Ben Graham said by cheap Warren Buffett said if you could buy a good business cheap, even better, we combine those two, and we used a crude database. You know, a simple database that was publicly available, all for a price that was publicly available, and we went and tested those two simple concepts &#8212; good and cheap.
It's not like we spun the computer thousands of times, this was the very first test we did and it came out so phenomenally well that I wrote a book about it called The Little Book That Beats The Market, that was the very first test we did, that's what I wrote up.
But my partner Rob Goldstein and I looked at each other and said you know I would call that the not trying very hard method, we actually know how to value businesses, you know couldn't we &#8212; it works so well without trying, could we even improve on this?
And so we built a big research team you know there's 13 of us now, we have a seven person tech team and what we're really trying to do is just take advantage of that initial research and actually valuing businesses and what we discovered was that and we were really building it for ourselves you know, hey can we do something with this?
But it turned out that only hundreds of names and being right on average was actually we can make more money because we would have much less volatile returns, we have and &#8212; we get what we expect more often by owning hundreds and being right on average and so it was very easy to put together as a long short portfolio, buying our favorite cheaper stock, shorting our most expensive, and because we were doing hundreds and because we're very good at valuing businesses on average, okay, as opposed to having to be right on every single one when you own six or eight which turned out we made more money because we had spend less time getting negative returns with a diversified portfolio.
When we discovered that, we were willing to take outside money again.",0
679,And this was back in March 09 is that &#8212;,"We opened our first fund for institutions in March 09, we opened our first mutual fund in 2012. And we made some decisions back in 2009, number one, we said that most hedge fund managed, because we were long short investing &#8212; we're charging too much, I have sat on Penn's investment board for 10 years, UJA for 10 years and I saw most of the managers out there and not many justify one and a half in 20 or two in 20.
And the other part that's wrong with the hedge fund businesses that when people pay those kind of prices, they are not very patient. So it's the worst of all worlds. You know, you're charging too much to your clients and they don't stay very long because they're either impatient when they're there paying so much. So we made two decisions, one is to make our fees very reasonable so we didn’t have a performance fee, we just had depending on the strategy you know maybe 2 percent management fee with nothing else on the hedge fund as opposed to two and 20, that was pretty novel at the time.
And the other was that instead of locking people in for a year or two or three we said its monthly liquidity, we don’t want to run money for you if you don't want to be with us.",0
680,30 days is not a big gate these days at all.,"Right, well the idea really was is that when you give a gate, every September or October, people have to decide whether they want to lock up for another year or two, when you have monthly liquidity, you're never forcing them to make a decision maybe the wrong time, they can always have their money and it's not a signaling device to say you should have a short time horizon, actually for what we do, you need a long time horizon. Well what it is a comfort to know you can always have it, and actually the money is stickier. So we thought those were two things wrong with the hedge fund business, people took out all the wrong times, they're charging too much, so we would leave our investors with more money and ability to have their money anytime actually turned to be a very sticky business.
And that's why three years later, we were able to get into the mutual fund business, not dilute our strategy, because we were not charging exorbitant rates, we weren't charging a performance fee on our hedge funds, and so we were able to turn institutional quality hedge funds into mutual funds without diluting our strategy.
If you're charging two in 20 to your or one and a half in 20 whatever it is to your investors, you can't move into the mutual fund space and just charge 1.5 percent or 2 percent because &#8212; without diluting your strategy because your institutional investors would get upset. So what ended up happening is that we ended up going to the mutual fund area because we were charging very reasonable fees that would also work in a mutual fund area.
But this is what we discovered and this is my long-winded way of answering your question, your very good question, how did we get into the Gotham Index Plus Strategy which is our new strategy?
Well, it turns out and we know this, but once we were able to come to investment advisers who talk to individual investors much more closely than institutional clients, the problem with active management in general is that to beat the market you have to do something different than the market.",0
681,High active share is in the parlance of the industry.,"Right, to beat the market, you have to do something different. But your returns are going to, as a result zig and zag differently. So I wrote a book called The Big Secret in 2011 and I still say it's a big secret because no one bought that or read that, so I'll just tell you about it. In it, I wrote a few studies of remember I wrote in 2011, so I wrote up the decade 2000 to 2010, this was a period where the market was flat but the best-performing mutual fund for that decade was up 18 percent a year, it's just that the average investor in that fund managed to lose 11 percent a year on a dollar weighted basis by moving in and out at all the wrong times.
And so every time the market went up, people piled into that fund, when market went down, they pile out, when the fund outperformed, they piled in, when the fund underperformed they piled out and they took that 18 percent annual gain when the market was flat so that's great on an annualized basis over 10 year period to beat the market by 18 points, but for outside investors, they went in and out so badly that the average investor on a dollar weighted basis lost 11 percent a year and &#8212;",0
682,Astonishing.,"It's astonishing and it's typical even for institutions, I wrote up the study of institutional managers so I took a look at the you know that study which showed the top-performing institutional managers for the same decade, 2000 and 2010, who ended up with the best ten-year record? Quartile? And what &#8212; who ended up in the top quartile what did that look like?
And what the study showed was that 97 percent of those who ended up with the best 10-year record spent at least three of those 10 years in the bottom half of performance, not shocking, but everyone, because to beat the market, you have to do something different, you are going to have periods of outperform &#8212; underperformance and everyone did.
79 percent of those who ended up with the best ten-year record spent at least three of those 10 years, at least three of the 10 years in the bottom quartile of performance and what I love is that 47 percent half, they ended up with the best 10-year record, but they spent at least three of those 10 years in the bottom decile, the bottom 10 percent of performers.
So you know no one stayed with them but that's how you end up with the best record.
So here's a conundrum, there's a minority of active managers who beat the market.",0
683,It&#8217;s still over a decade long period &#8212;,"Yes and it's very hard to find them upfront before they beat the market and if you do, it's almost impossible to stick with them because to beat the market you have to do something different than the market. So you know picking active managers has been over a loser's game for a long time even if there are some that win, and it's a minority, I agree it's a minority. And so my partner Rob and I took a look at this problem said how can we solve this because part of the reason we're doing this, we like making money but if we're not making money for other people which is there really is not a lot of sense and once we got to the mutual fund area we wanted to help individual investors take advantage of the fact that we think we know what we're doing.
So we develop something called Gotham Index Plus.",0
684,"So I was going to say Wes Gray of Alpha Architect, I don’t know if you are familiar with his work, has a piece I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m mangling the title but it something along the lines that even God would lose clients as an active manager and I just find that hilarious.
So what are you doing so differently with the Index Plus compared to what you are doing previously with special situations and what did your research find about how you can work around this problem of individuals underperforming their own investments?","Yeah so it sounds almost like an impossible puzzle, but I'll tell you how we solved it.
We said, number one, most people judge how they're doing for better or worse by seeing if they beat the S&amp;P 500, that's in this country and so we started there.
We said most people are going to stick with things if it's beating the S&amp;P 500 and lose if it's losing by too much to the S&amp;P 500, so we started with that base for Gotham Index Plus and we said you give us a dollar, we are going to buy the underlying stocks in the S&amp;P 500, we are going to put a dollar into that in the weights of the S&amp;P 500, so you give us a dollar, this is a mutual fund form, you give us a dollar, we re-create the S&amp;P 500 bottoms up, and put a dollar into the S&amp;P 500. Okay?
That doesn't sound so hard to do and don't think of ourselves as charging for that portion, that's pretty easy to do.",0
685,And you doing this not with indices but with actual &#8212;,"Yes, we bought the individual stocks because as you'll hear in a moment, we're very, very tax efficient so it helps us to own the individual stocks.
Then we go out and we buy $0.90 more of our favorite S&amp;P stocks within the mutual fund and &#8212;",0
686,And how many are that is that second the plus part?,"What happens is we to the 250 out of the 500 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that we like the best, we add $0.90 more of those in the order in which we like them. So the more we like something, the more we will add to it. And then we will short or we will sell $0.90 worth of the stocks we like the least, so we have a 90 long, 90 short, long short overlay on top of the dollar in the S&amp;P, but we do some things to mitigate because obviously if we are going to zig and zag too much, we want to have tracking error but positive tracking error.
People don’t mind winning all the time, it's the losing part that they don't like.",0
687,Of course.,"So we're trying to mitigate the losing part, so what we do with buying the cheapest socks we can find putting $0.90 into them in addition to the index, the dollar already in the index and we are shorting $0.90 of our least favorite, but we want to balance that 90-90 so we have zero beta on that 90-90 because we're already long a dollar in the market, we don’t want to keep the same beta as the market.
Number two we don't want to drive tracking error, so we don’t want small stocks to drive returns, so some things let's say 0.01 percent of the S&amp;P 500, we don't want that driving our returns but we may really like that stock, we may think it's really cheap so we will buy more of it and we may even buy five or eight times more of it but that's only 0.05 or 0.08 percent, not really going to drive returns, we will buy as much as we can subject to the constraints that we don't want to drive too much tracking error.
The third thing we do is we balance fundamentals. In other words the stocks were short at stock trading at 40, 50, 100 times earnings, these are hope stocks, people really think and they're buying them now not on current earnings but in 2022, they think it's going to be really great. So they're buying these, these are hope stocks based on the future, they are training at 40, 50, 100 times earnings and but there are other reasons why people like them, maybe sales are growing really quickly your other aspects of the fundamentals are going well so we balance those fundamental.
So if you took a look at our long portfolio, we have just as good sales growth in the cheap stocks were buying the expensive stocks we're shorting, so it's they're not unbalanced that way.
In other words, we're just getting them cheaper, they're cheaper, we're making &#8212; we are buying the cheapest stocks we can find, we are shorting the most expensive subject to constraints that keep us in line. One is there's a zero beta, two is that small stocks won’t drive returns, three is that we balance fundamentals so all we're doing is buying companies that are doing really well and we are just getting them cheaper. And as a result, we have been &#8212; we just passed a three-year anniversary in this fund, we got five stars from MorningStar, but more importantly, we beat all 1,200 funds in our category which a large cap blend where the S&amp;P is.
And the most important parties is that we didn't do nearly as well as I hope to do in the next three years, this was a very tough period for us. Even though we did very well relative to the other funds, we didn't do very well relative to our expectations and the reason for that is because the market with you know, excluding the last two months, went straight up during those three years with no corrections.",0
688,You have a big leverage short.,"We are short hope stocks, the $0.90 we're short are hope stocks, when you take risk and hope stocks and you get paid then you take more risk and you take more risk in and there's no correction so that's a very tough period for our short book.
Luckily our long book were not low as I said before, we are not low price-to-book low-price sales investors, we're cash flow oriented investors and people get very optimistic about our cash flows and our businesses when things are going well so our longs were able to keep pace with our shorts and even add three points a year to the &#8212; to that and we sort of &#8212;",0
689,So the plus long did better than the plus short and you still have the underlying S&amp;P?,"Correct so as index plus, but the great news is, is that spread that 90 by 90 long short spread actually does better in bad markets.",0
690,"Well, that was my next question, you took the words out of my mouth, if we were to see forget even another 2000 to 2002 or 08, 09 but I&#8217;m trying to think of a comparable &#8212; I was going to say 73, 74 but that&#8217;s not all that different from 08 09, but if we see a run-of-the-mill 20 percent to 30 percent correction that last eight months, how would you expect this to perform?","Well those are our best markets for our spread so obviously the index portion would do all that well. But you would want, we viewed as an index and your own protection, in other words, for that portion your portfolio, you want to be 40 percent 50 percent, 60 percent net long, if that's where your risk tolerance is, what's the smartest way to take that 100 percent long allocation to the market of that 40 or 50, 60?
And so what we like about Index Plus is really like owning the index with protection attached because you take high-priced caching companies out or company selling at 100 times pretax free cash flow or 50 times, they are going to take those guys out and shoot them in bad markets. these are hope stocks. Those are to get crushed &#8212;",0
691,"Tesla, Netflix, going on the whole &#8212;","All those guys are going to get crushed you know it turns out, you know, through all our research and everybody else is that buying things that 100 times earnings or things that are losing money is pretty much the world's worst strategy over time.",0
692,Shocker.,"And so in bad markets, even worse than that. Those stocks would get crushed, we're buying stocks that are have huge cash flows, people have low expectations for them that's why we're getting them so cheap and so we know pay for high expectations in the long book, so when the low &#8212; bad news comes in, we didn’t pay for high expectations so our longs tend to hold up better, our shorts are getting killed, great spreads and bad markets.
And let me just tell you where I think the market is. We value &#8212; we have a big research team and we value all the companies in the S&amp;P 500, we also value the top roughly 3000 companies, but we value the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 every day for the last 28 years, bottoms up, so I can contextualize where do we stand today relative to those 28 years and right now we stand in the 16th percentile towards expensive over those 28 years. Meaning the market's been cheaper 84 percent of the time for the S&amp;P, and cheaper 16 percent of the time.
Then I can go back and look at what's happening &#8212;",0
693,You mean more expensive 16 percent of the time.,"It's more expensive 16 percent of the time, cheaper 84 percent of the time, my apologies, so it's expensive. And we can go back in time and look at what's happened to the market over the next few years are from this valuation level in the past. It's not a prediction, it's just saying what's happened from this valuation level in the past and the answer to that is your forward returns have averaged three percent to five percent, two year forwards, eight to ten, not negative because the market averaged nine percent to ten percent returns during those 28 years and that's something we've come to get used to, not necessarily will continue in the future, but that's what we've come to get used to. We're more expensive than that.
So from the 16th percentile, expected returns about three percent to give percent, eight to ten over the next two years. So if we get close to what we're thinking over the next year, three to five and we tested this over 17 years before we went live, we were able to add about seven points to that so we can anywhere close to that and the markets only earning three to five, people really are going to enjoy those extra returns at that time.
Our best returns are actually in not up three percent to five percent which is very good returns, above average returns, but negative returns, we had double-digit spreads in all the four years that we looked at that the market in our tests that the market was down and that will be very precious to have, not lose money.
So you own the Index Plus protection, it's all more painless way to be long 100 percent long the market and we think people will stick with us because it's the underperformance periods would be way mitigated based on the way we're doing it and we are already long a dollar in the market.",0
694,"And you&#8217;re only owning companies that are within the S&amp;P 500, so my assumption is you can scale this pretty easily?","Right, well not only that but we also don't buy big positions and small pieces of the S&amp;P 500, so we're not worried about our capacity here, we're just worried about getting high returns for investors .",0
695,"That is quite fascinating.
I very vividly remember this book coming out in 97, 98 something like that and exploding like it came out of left field, I don’t think a lot of the investing public necessarily knew who you were and suddenly this book was everywhere. What motivated you to write this 20 years ago? 20 plus years ago?","I can't even explain why but I love investing and I always wanted to write and teach and investing is what I know about so I teach investing, I have been doing that at Columbia for 22 years and always wanted to write about it, and so You Can Be Stock Market Genius, see I can't even think of the name because &#8212; it was such a bad name but..",0
696,"It was a great marketing name, you may not love the name because it doesn&#8217;t really describe the contents of the book that well, but it certainly caught people&#8217;s attention.","Well it was really supposed to be Any Fool Can Be A Stock Market Genius, but the Motley Fools came out with a book and so I had about 24 hours to change the name and I was canvassing my family and my father said something like, how about You Can Be Stock Market Genius and then in parentheses Even If You're Not Too Smart and I kind of giggled about it and we put that in, and it turned out to be one of the worst titles ever &#8212;",0
697,"On the hardcover, the parentheses, Even If You&#8217;re Not Too Smart is part of that.","Yes, so &#8212; but I just really it was really a collection of war stories from you know we had talked about we had run outside money for 10 years doing 50 percent before fees for that period and how did we do that and you know how can you do that, and what is &#8212; what's the way you'd go about attacking that?
And I just had a fun time writing about the war stories and having a good time with it.",0
698,"So let&#8217;s talk a little but about some of those war stories. First, how well does the book hold up 20 years later?","Well I have five kids and made all my kids read it, number one, and so I still think it's everything in there is very valid you know many hedge fund managers, I did not write it for hedge fund managers, that's really who took to it the most, which is &#8212;",0
699,How to be an interesting surprise.,"Yeah I really wrote it to be friendly and funny and you know just have a good time doing it and I thought I was writing to an audience of average people, but you know, I hadn't started teaching at Columbia yet and I realized as soon as I taught my first class back in 96 that, I think I really wrote this at an MBA level because it was about at their level and that wasn’t my goal.
But you know now lots of these big hedge funds hand it out first day when someone walks in and says &#8220;go read this.&#8221;",0
700,"So let&#8217;s talk a little about spinoffs which was such an important part in the first let&#8217;s call it, a third of the book, 90 &#8212; the 20 years or more that proceeded this, a lot of M&amp;A, a lot of conglomerates being formed, it would make sense that the next era that follows it sees a lot of spinoffs but since the book came out, we&#8217;ve seen certainly in the past decade or so, less and less spinoffs, do you think that part of the analysis still holds true or is this just like everything else?","No, no, there are plenty of spinoffs and it's inherent now and people have done studies up through last year that show that they did much better than the market as a whole. But that wasn't really my point, my point is is that the nature of spinoffs is they are not underwritten securities, they're usually given to people who don't want them.",0
701,"There is an interesting behavioral element that you describe and 97 is long before behavioral finance was everywhere which is I expect people to get this and say this is not why I bought XYZ, I certainly didn&#8217;t buy it for the ABC spinoff, so the tendency for a lot of people to not even analyze it sell it and suddenly there&#8217;s a good cheap property there.","Right so maybe cheap, it may not be cheap, they're not usually well followed, so they are, I would call it mispriced it's right for mispricing, it doesn't really, all the studies that show the average spinoff does this or outperforms or doesn't outperform doesn't matter, what I was really trying to show people is places to look where things may be mispriced. And here, where people have never followed this company before, it's not being sold by an investment firm, given to people who don't really want it, it's right for mispricing, it could be underpriced, it could be overpriced, it doesn't matter which one, it's you know, I described in the book that it's you don't, no fun to take a shovel and dig holes, but if you're digging for buried treasure, it gets more interesting.
And so this is an area where it has a big red X on it where there could be a nice treasure underneath if you dig here, so it's worth doing the work in these areas. So right for mispricing is what I'd say, it doesn't really matter how the average spinoff does. However, they have done very well, there are some things as you mentioned, built into the system that make people get rid of them and then there a lot of other areas in the market that does that.
But the idea behind the whole book was sort of look where I started off with the my in-laws the first chapter was about my in-laws who used to shop in Connecticut for antiques and yard sales and country auctions and things like that.",0
702,"Artwork, you mentioned &#8212;","Yes, artwork and sculptures and all these things and they are looking off the beaten path and they are not looking in Manhattan on Madison Avenue, or you know, Fifth Avenue, they are really looking off the beaten path trying to find things that are undiscovered. But I made the point of saying they're not looking for the next Picasso, they are not finding a painting in some yard sale saying this guy is going to be the next Picasso, that's really hard to do.
What they're really looking for is a painting that they found the same artist had had done a painting that's of the similar idea that just went up for auction for three times the price it's being offered for over at Sotheby's so they recognize that right now, a similar pain just went for three times as much, that's a lot easier to do than to project or predict the next Picasso and so that's what they were doing, that's what you're doing in the spinoff area.
You are looking in &#8212; your bargain comes because you're looking a little harder than other people, you're looking at things that are a little harder to do, a little harder to find, probably smaller than most people are willing to look, not the main idea, usually these are discarded things and these are all things that are right for mispricing.",0
703,"That makes a lot of sense. In the book, there is something that cracked me up, you write never trust anyone over 30 and never trust anyone 30 and under. Essentially, never trust anyone.
Tell us a little bit about your thought process with that.","Well, when both of us were growing up, that was a saying never trust anyone over 30, I think anyone who is younger than we are probably doesn't even know that expression &#8212;",0
704,From the late 60s.,"Not as funny to them. Yes back in the 60s when we're going up, that's what you were so &#8212; you know don't trust a man, you know anyone over 30 and that was just my way of saying that you have to be your own boss, you have to look after caveat emptor in the investment world like everywhere else, most people are trying to sell you things, they have an angle, it is very hard for you to discern who is or who isn't on your side unless you do the work yourself and know what you're doing.
And so it's very important to know that and that's so, you know I gave a talk at Google a number months back and I started it this way, I said even Warren Buffett says that most people should just index and I started to talk saying I agree with him, then I left. I didn’t actually leave I said but then again Warren Buffett doesn't index and neither do I, how come?
And I explained the real opportunity set that's still out there. You know I get &#8212; you know is this still any good, does this stuff still work? I get &#8212; you know, I get a hand raised in my class at Columbia every year at least for the last five to six years, a student will raise their hand and sort of say, Hey Joel, congratulations on a nice 35 or 37 year career, but isn't the party over for us? There's more computers, the ability to crunch numbers, hedge fund, smart people doing the stuff, you know, are we going to have the same chances that that you had?
And so my students are second-year MBAs roughly 27 years old on average so I tell, this is the way I answer I say, I tell you what, why don’t we just go back to when you guys learned how to read, let's take a look at the most followed market in the world, that would be the United States, let's look at the most followed stocks within the most followed mark in the world, those would be the S&amp;P 500 stocks, and let's take a look at what's happened to the S&amp;P 500 since you guys you know learned how to read.
So I take them back 20 years when they were seven years old and I say from 1997 to 2000 the S&amp;P 500 doubled from 2000 to 2002, it halved, from 2002 to 2007 it doubled from 2007 to 2009, it halved, and from 2009 today it's roughly tripled, which is my way of telling the people are still crazy and it's way understating the case. Because the S&amp;P 500's an average of 500 companies, if you lift up the covers and look at the dispersion going on between those 500 companies, between which are in favor at any particular time in which are out-of-favor, the price movements are much wilder than what the average of 500 companies doubling and halving, doubling and halving, that doesn't even begin to tell the story.
So if you drew a horizontal line and call that fair value like Ben Graham said, and then you draw a wavy line around that horizontal line and call that stock prices, the market is pitching us opportunities all the time between stocks that are way below fair value and way above fair value, the reason investors don't beat the market has nothing to do with the market is not throwing us pitches in that it's not still emotional, they are behavioral problem, there's agency problems, there is a lot of other issues going on but it's not because we're not getting really great pictures all the time.
People are still emotional. If you're cold and calculating go back to what we talked about the beginning where stocks are ownership shares of businesses and you're just cold and calculating about what they're worth, you can really take advantage of the market, I actually tried to explain this concept a friend of mine who is an orthopedic surgeon asked me to speak to a group of his buddies at a big dinner that he was hosting for orthopedic surgeons said talk about the stock market for half an hour try to explain it and then take Q&amp;A. So I talked for half an hour, I started taking Q&amp;A, and when I was done, the questions were something like, hey oil went up two dollars yesterday should I buy some or market was down one percent yesterday, should I get out?
And my conclusion from that talk was that I had just crashed and burned and I had not really, really gone through these very learned doctors and then.",0
705,A notoriously difficult group to teach anything about because they believed themselves experts in everything.,"Well, I was asked to teach a much easier group, this was a group of ninth graders from Harlem.",0
706,Right.,"This was a couple years ago and just for one day a week, for an hour a week, we come in and teach them about the stock market and this was right after I crashed and burned with the very learned educated doctors and I didn't want to fail with the kids.",0
707,Right.,"But as you're saying I had fresh opportunity blue sky with them not know anything about the stock markets, so I really thought long and hard about how I was going to explain the stock market to them.
And so the first day class, I brought in a big &#8212; one of those old-time jars filled with jellybeans, you know, a big glass jar filled with jellybeans and I passed out 3 x 5 cards and I passed the jellybean jar around and I told him to count the rows and do whatever they had to do but write down how many jellybeans they thought were in the jar and went around the classroom and collected the 3 x 5 cards.
Then I said I'm going to go around the room one more time and ask you in front of everybody else have a jellybeans you think are in the jar and you can keep your guess from your 3 x 5 card, you can change your guess, that's completely up to you, and one by one I went around the room and I asked each student how many jellybeans they thought were in the jar and I wrote that answer down.
So let me tell you the results of the experiment the average for the 3 x 5 cards you know the first guess was 1771 jellybeans, that's what it average to, and there actually 1776, jellybeans in the jar.",0
708,Interesting.,"So that was pretty good and when I went around the room one by one asking each person publicly how many jellybeans they thought, that average gas was 850 jellybeans.",0
709,That&#8217;s interesting.,"And I explained to the kids that the second guess was actually the stock market and what I was to teach them to do is be the first guess, be cold and calculating, count the rows, be very disciplined in valuing the businesses not influenced by everyone else around them when the second guess what happened what everyone heard what everyone else was saying and in the stock market, everyone read the newspapers, they talk to their buddies, they see what everyone saying and doing and reading and seeing the results in the news every day and they are influenced by everything around and they're not being cold and calculating and disciplined.
And so I was going to teach them how to be cold and disciplined and that's what we try to do. We have a very disciplined process to value businesses and that's what I was teaching them to do and that's what stocks are, ownership shares of businesses and all the noise, 99.9 percent of the noise you read the paper every day excluding this podcast is really noise, and so that's &#8212; you know, that lesson really resonated, I think, and I did much better than the doctors.",0
710,"I would&#8217;ve guessed from the beginning you would&#8217;ve done better with the kids. I&#8217;m a big fan of Sturgeon&#8217;s Law which is 90 percent of everything is junk and when you talk about filtering out the noise and trying to get to the signal, hey the same thing is true across all sorts of different venues that that noise in the public is just it&#8217;s astonishing and I&#8217;m fascinated by that having people do it publicly and how that leads to such a different result especially when they came so close on average when they were private.
Let&#8217;s talk a little bit about one of your later books The Magic Formula, how did you make this transition from what looks like special situations investing to really quantitative investing?","Sure, well, I'm glad you brought up that way so I wrote a book called The Little Book That Beats The Market and we don't think of ourselves as quantitative investors although in The Little Book That Beats The Market, we used some simple quantitative methods to show people concepts of Ben Graham said buy it cheap, his best student's a guy named Warren Buffett who said if I can buy good business cheap even better and that made him one of the richest people in the world and we have used that philosophy, that's what I teach at Columbia that's what we've used to make money over the last 37 years, buying good and cheap businesses and wanted to share that with everyone else and so we ran a statistical test just to show that just using crude metrics for cheap and crude metrics for good and crude metrics for a and crude database that we could do very well.
And so that's what we show the magic formula and we said the magic formula only really has two parts, cheap and for cheap, we really rank companies based on a simple metric that was earnings before interest and taxes to enterprise value and I usually describe that as rent, in some other words, you are buying a house and they are asking $1 million and your job is to figure out whether that's a good deal or not.
So there is fairly simple questions you'd ask if you try to figure that out. One would be if I rented out this house how much could I get for it after my expenses?",0
711,What is your return on capital?,"No, so return on capital would be how the business invests its own money, it's really as the investor what price do I have to pay for the house and how much is it going to earn me?
So as an investor, it's my return on capital, but I don't want to confuse that with how the business itself invests its money which is really how I look at return on capital.",0
712,Got it.,So there is &#8212; to it's really return on investment.,0
713,Okay.,"I'm laying out $1 million getting $80,000 a year in rent, that might be 8 percent and net of my expenses and interest rates are two or three percent, that may look pretty attractive, there are other questions you probably ask you know if we were really doing this analysis, you would probably say, hey what are the other houses on the block going for the block next door and the town next door, how relatively cheap is this?
And we do the same thing. We say how cheap is this business relative to similar companies, how cheap is it relative to all companies, how cheap is it relative to history, that's what we do at Gotham but for the purposes of the little book that beats the market, we just did cheap on a free cash flow basis just like how much rent. But and it's a very simple metric and then we said, you know, I described this a little bit earlier, we talked about it, is I was trying to describe &#8212; I wrote this book for my kids and I said how do you describe how good the business is?
And if you read through Buffett's letters it's very clear that is looking for businesses that are in high returns on tangible capital and I described that is every business needs working capital, every business needs fixed assets, how well does it convert its working capital and fixed assets into earnings?
So I said if you're building a store, you have to buy the land, you have to build the store, you have to set up the displays, you have to stock with inventory and if all that cost you $400,000 and the store earns you $200,000 a year, that's a 50 percent return on tangible capital, and I compared that to a store I called in the book of Just Broccoli and &#8212;",0
714,Which is not going to return a lot.,"No, just broccoli selling just broccoli in your stores probably not a good idea, I never tried it but it's probably not a good idea but you still have to buy the land, build the store, set up the display, stock with inventory, still going to cost you roughly the same $400,000 but because it's a dumb idea maybe only earns $10,000 a year that's 2 1/2 percent return on tangible capital and all I said in the book was all things being equal, if I can get the same price, I would much prefer to own the business that can reinvest its money 50 percent returns than 2 1/2 percent returns.
And so what I did for the books purposes is something very crude, I ranked all companies based on how cheap they were and then I took another ranking of how good they were, what kind of returns on tangible capital they were getting, then I combined those two ranks and bought the best combination of cheap and good and I showed how well that works, it worked so well just using these crude metrics that the top 10 percent combined score for cheap and good did better than the second 10 percent, did better than the third 10 percent, in order all the way down to the bottom 10 percent, just showing you the power of how this cheap and good works so well.",0
715,"And if I&#8217;m getting these numbers right, from 1988 to 2004 this portfolio would&#8217;ve returned about 30 percent a year while at the same time the market would&#8217;ve given you a little over 12 percent, is that about right?","Yes so that was with small-cap stocks which unless you're an individual investor would be hard to take advantage of as a institutional investor but I also did a similar study for the thousand largest companies, you know, the Russell 1000 companies, and you know which are very similar to the S&amp;P 500 and that that was 22 percent versus about 12 percent.",0
716,"Also pretty good year, I will take that.",And possibly little more realistic for large investors.,0

We love your comments, feedback, and suggestions, write to us at MIBPodcast@Bloomberg.net, you can check out my daily column on BloombergView.com follow me on twitter @Ritholtz, I&#8217;m Barry Ritholtz, you&#8217;re listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio.
Welcome to the podcast, Joel, thank you so much for doing this and I&#8217;ve been looking forward to this for long time, you and I have never met, never really spoken before, but I&#8217;ve been very much aware of who you are and what you&#8217;ve done over the years and I have tell you some of the numbers that you have put up and I know there&#8217;s only so much we can talk about them are just astonishing.
We talked about the 50 percent a year before fees for 10 years, that&#8217;s an amazing run, like Renaissance Technology that returned capital to investors, I have to imagine people were not especially happy when after 10 years of the sort of returns, you said here, I have to give you this back. What was motivating, was it strictly scale or was there &#8212; were there other factors that said I&#8217;m done managing other people&#8217;s money at that at that point in time.","You know, that's a great question.
I thought about that a lot, I love investing, never was going to quit, we had gone to a size I suppose after 10 years of having nice returns that we could keep our staff and continue to run our internal money and for me it's just fun to do.",0
718,"Did you think that at that size, you couldn&#8217;t continue generating those sort of returns.","Well, I think, you know, I left out you had asked me how we did 50 percent a year and you know one was I said we stayed small, two, we were concentrated, and three, really we got lucky.",0
719,Right.,"Okay? that you have to have some luck to get those kind of returns during that period of time and so one of the most fortunate people on the planet I have a large family with five kids, I love doing this, I like to do really well so there's pressure I put on myself when I'm running other people's money, maybe have a little less so when I'm not running it, so I don't think it was really a calculated plan other than you know how can I continue to enjoy what I'm doing in the best way and still get to do what I like, and still work with the people I like to do.
And so it seemed like the right thing to do at the time I guess is the best way I can &#8212;",0
720,"That makes sense and it took almost 20 years before you started, that&#8217;s really a decade.",About 14 years.,0
721,14 years before you said it took that long to forget the stress of running other people&#8217;s money?,"Well you know when you own six or eight names, one of the issues there is that every two or three years, pretty much like clockwork and wake up and lose 20 percent or 30 percent of my net worth in a couple days because one or two things weren't going our way, either we were wrong or just you know they went the wrong way for a little while, we knew what we owned, we were going to get paid back and that's a little more stressful.",0
722,Sure.,"And it had to happen, when you are not concentrated, that has to happen, a little more stressful with other people's money since I know what we owned and A, I'm a big boy so when I make a mistake you know, I just chalk it up to a learning experience and move one.",0
723,Right.,"Let's just say I think my investors were great but maybe they wouldn’t be so kind that that happened and it did seem to happen every two to three years and I think that's unavoidable.
So when we developed a strategy to take advantage of our principles meaning buying good cheap businesses and shorting expensive ones that were trading way above what we thought they were worth, when we discovered that we can actually make more money having diversified portfolios and that are bad days would be 20 or 30 basis points of underperformance not 20 percent to 30 percent down, that was A, it wouldn’t degrade our own returns taking other money when we had hundreds of stocks on the long and short side. And B, it wouldn't hurt our own returns because more diversity helped our returns because when you don't get what you expect, meaning you get aberrationally bad returns, sometimes it ends up in negative compounding.
So when you have hundreds of stocks more diversity on each side, you get less aberrationally bad returns, that is why insurance companies don’t insure five people because even if you do great underwriting of those five people someone steps off a curb, you can tell I don't sell insurance but if someone steps off a curb and ruins all your numbers, it didn't matter what kind of underwriting you did of that say, life insurance.",0
724,"It&#8217;s too small a pool, you need a much bigger pool.","Yes, so, if you can be right, you know they want to be right on average, so they want to be right over hundreds or thousands of people and so when we realize that we can make more money being more diversified when you go long short and put on leverage you want at that, it didn't hurt us to take outside money, because diversity was good for us and you know, to cover so many companies, we need a big research teams would build up our research team and our tech team to help us trade, you know, where &#8212; tech team one guy we have you know was a MIT chess champ, another guy was won Google code jam, you know out of 25,000 people, another guy's you know that as smart as those guys so I get to work with the tech team and they help us trade efficiently, they help us trade tax efficiently.
So we're very, very tax efficient, help us all put together the systems where our fundamental analysts can cover a broad range, so it's been fun building a team to do all these different things, so I'd say we're fundamentally, we fundamentally value businesses but our tech team helps us put together risk-adjusted portfolios very well and trade efficiently and be tax efficient all those things and just building this whole thing as, you know, doing something with the same principles that we've always used has been really just fine.",0
725,Tell us the most important thing people don&#8217;t know about your background?,"Well I don't know what they don't know, I've written three books and I always tell personal stories within the book, so I think I've included lots of embarrassing things.
I yeah I don't think I've ever written that I enjoy playing tennis, I did write that I enjoy sailing and that I'm not very good at it and I've been in a bunch of close calls with that but that's probably how I spend most of my leisure time as well as along with my family, so there's nothing really too fascinating.",0
726,Tell us about some of your early mentors.,"Well, you know, one of the reasons I read books is because my mentors really came from reading people who were kind enough to share with me their wisdom over time and that's you know people like Andrew Tobias and Benjamin Graham and even Buffet in his letters and David Dreman, you know who wrote Contrarian Investment Strategy and John Train who wrote the Money Masters and all these people really were helpful in forming and getting me involved in investing and you know I wanted to share some the things that I learned too because that's how I learned.
It really wasn't so much you know some the people were dead and they were still sharing with me and some of the people were just kind to do so and I you know, one of my ways you know besides the fact that I enjoy writing, it was another way that I felt I could give back.",0
727,"So let&#8217;s talk about some books. What were some of your favorite books? You have already mentioned the two from Graham Intelligent Investor and Security Analysis, what other books did you find influential? Be they finance not finance fiction and nonfiction, what really stayed with you? You mentioned David Dreman on Contrarian Strategies, that&#8217;s an interesting book.","Yeah, well there is a book called The Invisible Heart which explains basic economics to most people and most people are today, you know especially young people are kind of more socialists &#8212;",0
728,"Isn&#8217;t the old-line socialists in your youth and capitalist in your older age, I know I&#8217;m mangling that.","Yes, no, I know the reference and that's partially true, it's just discouraging to me that the understanding basic economics is kind of necessary and so there's a book that's a fiction book, to &#8212; Russ Roberts wrote it called The Invisible Heart, not many people have read it but it's a very short book that I think most people should read, so I would read that, I would have my kids read that.",0
729,"Russ Roberts also maintains a blog, is he the same one?","Yes, yes, yes.",0
730,And does he do &#8212; actually Econ talker or something like that.,"He probably does, I haven't followed that, it is a book about economics, it's a fictionalized book about a high school economics teacher, but is just a pleasant short book way to learn basic principles are so I'd highly recommend that even if you want to be in the you know, no formulas, just want to be &#8212; you want to understand basic economic principles. I think that's one of the best the people haven't seen.
I think for investing Moneyball was one of the great if you're a sports fan at all just understanding how to buy undervalued players is very similar to buying undervalued stocks and so that's a really helpful book for most people.
I just read a book I'll call the Power Of Moments which I really enjoyed which says that most of your seminal moments in your life really come between the ages of 15 and 30, because you have a lot of firsts, you know it's the first time you graduate and leave home, might be your first girlfriend, you graduating college, you getting your first job, you might be getting married, you might have kids, all happens in that kind of compact period for most people and people think back to the rest of your life about those seminal moments and it is really about a book about creating your own moments.
In other words, those happen because those are natural firsts, those happen naturally because of evolution but can you create those kind of important moments in your life and it really comes down to creating doing new things, always creating &#8212; you have to be a little more creative when you get older to create those new things but those are the things you think about which I think are quite important.
I'm also reading another book now which I think I'm having a lot of fun with which is &#8212; I think it's called Never Split The Difference is by the ex-chief hostage negotiator for the FBI, you know just negotiating and also thinking of you know how you can apply some of these concepts to business you know to be effective. So enjoyed that. You know everyone has to read Interesting Investing, Intelligent Investor, you know I think it's chapters 8 and 20, Buffet always points out and agree with that.
I think Buffett wrote a bunch of letters that were compiled by Lawrence Cunningham that get (ph) into topics, and that was laid out and I always assign that in my class which I just think is a great, great book and you mention my three books three times and so you have to read those too.",0
731,Tells us about a time you failed and what you learned from the experience?,"I will talk about my worst investment, not specifically what it was but it but it was an investment in a tradeshow company all that I bought through was really I created through a spin off and shorted one thing and bought another and I actually paid $3 for something that I was immediately going to get $6 for but I fell in love with the business and actually ended up did I paid three dollars for the eventually in short order, went way past the six dollars because I love the business it went to $12 a share which was pretty good but I had a very large position in it at that time and what I loved about the business was A, it ran a computer tradeshow called Comdex in Las Vegas and I loved the business because plenty of space in Las Vegas, if they got more clients to display at their tradeshow they, could just rent more space for $2 and resell it for $62, they didn’t have to commit, it so that was like a $60 contribution for every incremental sale they could make and that's generally called operating leverage.
And that's what I loved about the business and I think people are very familiar with financial leverage, right? If you put up a dollar and I borrow $9 and buy something worth $10, you realize that if that $10 thing you bought falls a dollar or two, you are going to go broke and everyone understands that, that's very straightforward.
So this was my lesson and operating leverage you know unfortunately after 9/11, right before 9/11 the tradeshow bought another tradeshow, they borrowed a lot of money to buy it and then 9/11 happened and people didn't want to travel.
And so I learned a lesson in operating leverage where when you don't get that $62 and it only cost you $2, $60 dollars of less earnings drop straight to the bottom line as well and it's called operating leverage and I just thought I'd describe that to you so that people would realize that on the way up, just like financial leverage is a lot of fun and on the way down operating leverage on the way down is not very much fun. So I got out most of my stock in about a dollar so I will just leave it at that say &#8212;",0
732,That&#8217;s a lesson.,"That's right, an investment lesson in operating leverage, at least be aware.",0
733,"Our last two questions, what sort of advice would you give a millennial or recent college graduate who told you hey, I am interested in going into financials as a career.","Well you know I taught at Columbia as I mentioned for the last 22 years and so I tell my students that first day of class actually, I tell them that you know I don't think there's a lot of social value in being an investment manager, it's not that I don't think investors who do work set help set prices and allocate capital and all those things, but I just think A, they're not very good at it, and B, it'll get done without you.
And smart people doing this, too much horsepower rather than go into other fields. I have loved being in this field, I enjoy it and there's nothing wrong with it. But what I tell my students is I'm even one step removed from doing something I don’t think is that socially valuable because I'm teaching you how to do something that's you know, so what am I doing here and so what I make my students promise and I think they take to it well is that if I do teach them and I am helpful in learning how to do this and they enjoy it, there's nothing wrong with it, it's a great thing but they should think of a way to give back.
They you know, we get way overpaid in this business, we're successful, and if they're successful with what I teach them and I I'd say that to any young person, if they are successful in this field, I think they should really think of our different ways, they're clearly smart people, they are clearly driven people, they're thoughtful and so they should be able to think of a way to give back and use the skills for that.
And so that's what I tell young people who want to go to the investment business.",0
734,"And our final question, what is it that you know about investing today that you wish you knew 37 years ago when you were first starting.","I would say probably the secret to being successful is patience. The big secret that no one bought them and will tell everyone is really just having a longer time horizon than most people and understanding what you're doing, meaning you're buying businesses, and if you're good at valuing them, I actually make a promise to my students first day class every year, I promise them if they do good valuation work, the market will agree with them.
I just never tell them when. It could be a couple of weeks, it could be two or three years, but if they do good work, the market will agree with them and to keep that in mind to continue to do good work and have patience. And you know, since you can check your stock price 30 times a minute now, you know, we used to get when I was you know coming to the business, used to get a quarterly statement and throw right in the garbage, you know, and really care that much.
Now minute to minute, you know, even our best investors, you know, $20 billion endowments expect weekly returns from us in our private funds, I have no idea what they do with that information but that's what they're asking for and everyone is judged on very short time horizon.
So if you can step back and take a longer time horizon, that is the big secret that I could share and the sooner you learn that and the sooner I learned that, the better off that they and I will be.",0
735,"So let’s start a little bit with the book, &#8220;Common Sense.&#8221; What &#8212; first of all, what motivated you working in finance to write a book about opportunity, growth and equality? It seems to be a little different than your traditional value investing or is it?","Sure. Well, I’m a capitalist. I’d like to &#8212; to work well.
An investor, in general, has a &#8212; a certain way of looking at the world. And there are a lot of problems that capitalism has led to or the way at least we implement it. And &#8212; and so there are certain things that seemed fairly reasonable to me to suggest of tweaks we can make to the way the system works now to &#8212; to make things better for everyone.
And so, you know, most people don’t write this book from the perspective of a long-term investor, and &#8212; and so that’s what I did here. And &#8212; and I hope it brings another perspective to solve some of these problems, particularly the ones that are very important to people now including inequality and opportunity.",0
736,"So let’s dive right into issues of opportunity. By page count, almost half the book &#8212; maybe even more &#8212; is about education. So let’s start &#8212; let’s start there. You &#8212; you started a not-for-profit charter school in New York City in 2006. Why did you do that? And what did you learn?","Well, sure. Well, the reason I did that is if you look at the statistics, if you are black, Hispanic, low-income in one of our major urban centers, maybe the top 50, your odds of graduating college right now were one out of 11. We know the college graduates are 70 percent more than high school graduates. High school graduates are 30 percent more than dropouts, but that’s &#8212; that’s huge. And it’s not from lack of ability. At least that’s part of the reason that I got involved in a charter school space.
Everyone has choice. If &#8212; if you have any kind of money in our system and you don’t like the school in your neighborhood, you can move to a neighborhood with a good school or you can send your kids to a private school. If you don’t have means, you get what you get and you don’t have a choice. And the idea behind charter schools, which just to define them are publicly-funded schools run not by the district, meaning run by independent operators.
And it turns out that the charter schools in states where they have high standards of who gets to open one and who gets to keep running one &#8212; or, obviously, if they’re close if they’re not doing well, all those tend to be the states like New York, Massachusetts and California where the charter schools do well. And so the idea was to set-up a &#8212; a charter school in New York City, and it’s always OK or it’s been done before to open one school and put a lot of resources into it, make sure that it works well. And the idea behind this one was to do something replicable. And the big hairy audacious goal when we got started was to open up one school, but 40 schools.
My &#8212; my business partner John Petrie and I hired a woman, Eva Moskowitz, who was the CEO and founder of the Success Network that I’m involved with. And today we have 46 schools and 20,000 kids. And last year, according to the state test in Math and English, those 20,000 kids in all low-income neighborhoods &#8212; minority neighborhoods outperformed every wealthy district in the state, including Scarsdale, Great Neck and all the other top districts in the state. They would be the number one district. …",0
737,Wow. What’s the lesson from that? What can we learn from charter schools and bring to public schools that are underperforming?,"Well, I think the biggest lesson would be that it’s not lack of ability that the kids aren’t successful. The kids can do it. If you have high expectations, the kids can meet them. They just need the right supports.
And charters, of course, have some advantages over the district schools. They get to select their teachers and keep the ones that they think are doing a good job. They could pivot quickly to &#8212; to only do what works or to improve things that aren’t working, and they can do that very quickly.
We spent 30 percent more time in school at our charter than the district schools. So that’s an advantage. And a big advantage is parents choose to come. And so it’s good to have the support of the parents, and that is an advantage.",0
738,"In your book &#8220;Common Sense,&#8221; you highlight PS 172, one of the country’s best public school. It’s run by Jack Spatola. What makes him such a special principal? Why is that public school, not a charter school, why is that succeeding so well versus the average public school in any big city?","Right. So the book, as you suggested, is not just about charters, it’s about good schools anywhere, giving good choices, right? The &#8212; the &#8212; the kids with the lowest family &#8212; the families with the lowest means don’t have a choice. So it’s how can we make their district schools better, how can we give them choice of a good &#8212; a good school choice.
And they’re certainly good district public schools, one that I highlighted. You suggest Jack &#8212; Jack Spatola is the principal &#8212; he just retired &#8212; for PS 172 in Brooklyn. But to tell you how good &#8212; a really good school can be and this is a district school, 99 percent of the kids passed the Math exam and 94 percent passed the English exam. And in most other schools, it’s below 40 percent.
But that’s not the special thing. The special thing is that that 99 percent passing Math and 94 percent passing English, what are the statistics for the students with disabilities at that school? So in other words, kids without disabilities did less than half as well in the &#8212; in the regular district schools. That tells you how good that school is. The English language learners, 90 percent passed the English exam at his school, PS 172, in the regular district schools with nine percent, so 10 times better.",0
739,"What can be done with a school, like Spatola’s like PS 172, that can be ported over to regular public schools?","Of course, that’s the right question. And if you ask Jack Spatola, the principal, he would say having high expectations for every child. Just keep looking if something doesn’t work for students, find something else. If that doesn’t work, find something else and keep working, but it’s high expectations, expecting that each child, including students with disabilities, including language learners can do the job with the right supports.
So he would say that. But I would say that only one principal can be the best principal in the state. It’s probably Jack.
It’s very hard to &#8212; it would be wonderful if the average principal could be this good. And &#8212; and we strive to get there, but it hasn’t happened.
And I just point out that good charter schools, you know, with &#8212; you know that where kids &#8212; poor and minority kids outperform the wealthiest districts, and a school like Jack’s where even the kids with disabilities are crushing it point out that the kids can do it. So the 10 out of 11 who are not graduating college, it’s the &#8212; not from lack of ability. And so the question I posed in the book is what can we do for them they can do the job, they can do the job. And so that’s what I used them for.
It’s a big, big question you’re asking how do we move this, you know, Jack’s success across the districts. And &#8212; and one of the sad answers is that not everyone can be Jack Spatola. But, of course, he should be studied, and so a real question should be why isn’t what he’s done, studied even more, and it &#8212; and it’s not. So that’s a little sad.
But right now, it doesn’t look like those 10 out of 11 are being serviced. What can we do about that is what I read about in the book.",0
740,"Let’s talk about one of the solutions you write about, alternative credentials. What are they and how would they work for &#8212; for students coming from these disadvantaged neighborhoods in schools?","Yeah. So I &#8212; I call it alternative certification. So I point out the &#8212; the 10 out of 11 that the current system isn’t working for. And I &#8212; and I write in the book &#8212; you know, I want to pose this question when Tiger Woods was at the top of his game to my students at Columbia. I said, &#8220;You know, how do you beat Tiger Woods?&#8221; And my answer was, &#8220;Don’t play him in golf.&#8221; And the idea that I suggested in the book is something I called alternative certification.
And so I’ll give you an example. Let’s say you want to work in the H.R. Department at Microsoft. What I’m suggesting is Microsoft should simply specify which tests, courses or certificates in lieu of a college degree that they would consider when judging applicants for high-paying job in that particular department? So these &#8212; these things could include a simple literacy test, an online course, a certificate program or even a game-based test, and the list together with McKinsey has created game-based test that measure decision-making and critical thinking skills. So it doesn’t have to be a standard test. There’s a lot of different ways you can test for talent.
And so what I suggest in the book is that leading companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, J.P. Morgan, they wouldn’t have to create these tests or courses or administer them. What they would do is merely make public a list of which tests, which courses, which certificates would be considered in lieu of a college degree when selecting candidates for specific jobs, (inaudible) for passing these things.",0
741,What’s the response?,"That’s when the whole ecosystem would develop, sorry. Go ahead.",0
742,"Well, I was going to ask, what’s the response been like from corporate America?","Well, you know, the book just came out, so I’m very hopeful. And one of the reasons I’m talking on your show, Barry, is to get this idea out there. It’s already starting in some ways, but the idea behind it is once there’s a buyer, in other words, all these big companies have to do is make the list public. What we will consider in lieu of a college degree and then a whole ecosystem, hopefully, will develop the supporting online resources and tutoring services were developed to help applicants pass these tests and courses and meet the new demand from these top companies. Great thing about this is none of it would require government involvement, and the cost would be much, much lower than the current systems.
Now you might ask … … what do you do for students with disadvantaged backgrounds from disadvantaged backgrounds. And I would assume they were also developed as long as there was this demand at the end of the day for passing these courses is that there would also be prerequisite courses that would develop as well, whether online or in-person teaching and supporting resources that would all be rated like Uber drivers and Airbnb rentals.
Once again, none of it would require government involvement. They would be setting standards. They wouldn’t need government funding.
Now, this is already starting. Google has already created six-month certificate courses in a few technical areas, which, if you pass, they’ll consider you for a job. But I’m suggesting something much simpler where companies just set standards of which existing tests or new test that they would look at or courses or certificates that you could receive that they’ll consider. So I think it would really jumpstart this whole sort of runaround. You know, in other words, don’t play him in golf, run around the current system because it’s just so unfair. This is what the 10 out of 11 could try to pursue without any government assistance.
It’s not ideal. It’s not first choice. Of course, we want great schools and we could just keep working at it, but this is something these major corporations can do right now &#8212; set these standards and then hopefully this whole ecosystem will get going.",0
743,"Quite fascinating. Let’s talk a little bit about too big to fail banks. You wrote, quote, &#8220;Banks are almost wired to get into trouble,&#8221; unquote. Explain.","Well, it’s pretty straightforward. You know, money is fungible, so who pays the most? The depositors. Who lends money to borrowers the cheapest and with the easiest terms is who wins. The industry is competitive and it’s very leveraged. So pretty straightforward why banks are wired to get into trouble.
So what can we do to make these banks no longer too big to fail? How do we make them safer for both taxpayers and investors?",0
744,"Well, you know, in 2008, after the 2008 banking crisis, there are plenty of regulations including Dodd-Frank and made the whole system a lot safer than it was. But more regulations have very high costs. There’s a lot of repercussions from a lot of regulations (inaudible). You know, mostly only big banks can handle them. Smaller banks are dropping and closing like flies, and almost no new small bank charters are being applied for because small banks can’t afford all these regulations.
Also under the system, banks are penalized for making small business loans. It hits them from the new risk factor, so corporate bank loans under a million dollars dropped by 75 percent since 2008. And we know what’s happened to new business formation. It’s way, way down.
The other problem is we also have itself too big to fail. The Minneapolis Feds still &#8212; came out with a study saying that it’s still two out of three chance that we’ll need another government bailout in the next century. And so we are hurting small businesses and small banks, and we have itself too big to fail with all these regulations. So I write in the book about &#8212; I tell a story about in the &#8212; the late 18th century, early 19th century, the English used to ship their prisoners to Australia. And in one of the earliest trips about 40 percent of the prisoners died along the way, which was horrific.
And so how would you solve a problem like that? Well, obviously, you could solve it with more regulations covering the medical care for the prisoners, and food on board, and safety and cleanliness, and put more government monitors onboard. There’s a lot of things you could do to try to solve that problem.
The other thing you could do is to change the incentives from the beginning and say to the ship captains, &#8220;We’ll pay you for the prisoners if they get to Australia alive and well, and we’ll penalize you for those who don’t,&#8221; right? So it’s setting incentives up from the beginning rather than micromanaging all the regulation.
And so I suggest sort of the same thing with banks. You know, when a restaurant fails, the economy doesn’t skip a beat. It’s not true with banks. The financial system is too big, it’s too intertwined. And &#8212; and we need to do something.
Right now we’re really the backstop, meaning we do have to bailout the banks if &#8212; if things turn bad, especially the biggest ones. And so one of the clear answers would be if, you know, there’s less than 10 percent equity cushion in the banks, there have been a lot of things in Dodd-Frank that, you know, go to risk control, types of equity, things of that nature.
But I just suggest in the book that if we brought &#8212; if we set the incentives up correctly upfront so that you had 20 to 30 percent equity, what I suggest is a new type of preferred, not &#8212; not common equity. But to increase by 10 percent common equity to 20 or 30 percent using a new type of preferential preferred, where the preferred is deductible for the bank, it’s tax-free for the holder. So obviously it’s helping the banks.
But when things go bad for the banks, if you don’t have 30 percent equity, anything that goes bad is the bank’s problem. It’s like the restaurant failing.","Well, it’s pretty straightforward. You know, money is fungible, so who pays the most? The depositors. Who lends money to borrowers the cheapest and with the easiest terms is who wins. The industry is competitive and it’s very leveraged. So pretty straightforward why banks are wired to get into trouble.
So what can we do to make these banks no longer too big to fail? How do we make them safer for both taxpayers and investors? No one really CARES. It’s an equity holder, and I suggest the incentives are set-up that both the board and management are incented by the combined value of the equity and the preferred as if they’re stapled together as one security. So we set the incentives up correctly. You’d still have a leveraged returned from the common equity portion. But if there’s any problems, it would be covered by the preferred holders.
It sounds like we’re giving a bonus to the banks to make this deductible for the banks and to make it tax-free, but actually we &#8212; we won’t have too big to fail anymore. We’ll have plenty of equity and they’ll cover their own. The &#8212; the losses will fall where they should. The incentives will be aligned correctly from the beginning. It’s &#8212; it’s a pretty simple solution to a difficult problem.",0
745,"Right. That would require a little bit of legislation to both create that class of preferred, make it deductible to the bank and make it tax-free to the investors is &#8212; and essentially, you’re asking the investing public to step in in place of the taxpayer to make sure banks have a big enough capital cushion.","Right. We’re already supporting banks for a good reason, right? We already support them so that depositors don’t lose their money and we don’t have (inaudible) depression. So this is more upfront way of doing it.
If we’re just a backstop that’s going to have to backstop in a crisis, we’re there but it’s kind of hidden. Here … … we take care of it upfront. Yes, we’re giving a benefit to the preferred, but we’re very upfront about it. And we then align the incentives exactly how they should be, that shareholders whether the preferred or common will take all the losses, not the government.",0
746,"And this solves too big to fail because even if there’s a major crisis and banks lose 15, 20, 25 percent of their capital it doesn’t wipe them out.
If I remember in the book, banks currently are running seven, eight, nine percent of capital reserve. Is that about right?","They are. And I go &#8212; I go through the math. I mean, you know, with all the different risk controls and &#8212; and then there is subordinated debt that turns into equity now, but I argue in the book that we’re not going to really pull that lever. We’re not going to force some big bank to convert its subordinated debt into equity even though that’s one of the options we now have. And &#8212; and that’s because, you know, it’ll cost a crisis of its own. It’ll cause a cascade. And that’s what Neel Kashkari argues, too, at the Minneapolis Fed. And &#8212; and I agree with that.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)",0
747,"So if we make this new type of preferred available, it becomes strictly voluntary for the banks to do it or are they obligated to change our capital structure to have 15, 20, 30 percent capital and reserve with this new type of preferred share class?","Right. So if they want to be free of certain regulations that are protective otherwise, they can issue this preferred and &#8212; and therefore take the risk themselves. Otherwise, they’d be subject to a lot of restrictions on the type of loans they can make and things of that nature so &#8212; which is stuff we’re already doing.",0
748,Quite fascinating. Let’s talk a little bit about what’s going on with young people today investing. What do you think of the rise of Robin Hood investors? Is this a good thing or is this just bored millennials at home without access to sports or socializing?,"Barry, I don’t think it’s a great thing. I think it is good to be exposed to investing for most people and to be thinking about saving for retirement. But I &#8212; you know, when we saw on the Internet bubble, you know &#8212; you know e-trade and the other discount brokers, most of those people lost a lot of money. I &#8212; I think you’re speculating without knowing what you’re doing is not a great idea.
And so, you know, I wrote a book called &#8220;The Big Secret,&#8221; and I think you’ve heard me say it’s still big secret because no one thought that particular book, but talked about the best performing mutual fund. I wrote in 2011 for the decade 2000 to 2010, and that fund was up 18 percent a year when &#8212; during a decade where the market was flat. Yet the average investor in that fund managed to lose 11 percent by moving in and out at all the wrong time. And that’s because people are emotional. If you don’t really understand what you’re investing in, you pile in when things are going well. You pile out when they’re not going well. When something’s working, you put more in. When it’s not working, you put less in. And you make all the wrong moves. And I think when things turn around for these investors, it’ll end up not great.",0
749,"So you’ve been teaching for a long time, not only lecturing MBA students at Columbia, but you also teach a bunch of ninth graders at a high school in Harlem. What’s the difference between those two students and what are you trying communicate to each group?","Sure. Well, it’s interesting question. You know, I &#8212; I &#8212; I taught a couple of years the ninth graders for a semester. And I tried to, at a very early age, explain to them the concept of compounding. And I actually put on the front of their little notebooks a compound interest example, where if you start saving at age 19 and you put in $2,000 a year, and you do that for seven years, and you’re on 10 percent on your money. And then you never put in another nickel, you just do it for seven years starting at 19.
The other example, if you started age 26 and saved $2,000 a year invested at 10 percent and save for 40 years, meaning putting $2,000 a year starting at age 26 for 40 years, the &#8212; this these person who started investing at 19 and only putting seven payments of $2,000 ends up earning more money just with seven payments by the time they’re 65 than the person who started seven years later at age 26 and put in 40 payments. So it just talks about how starting to save and invest early is very important. And so teaching in ninth grade it’s important for students to understand that concept.
My average MBA student is already 27 so, of course, they had a lot going for them and so I’m not too worried about them. But it is a huge advantage to start early. And I &#8212; I &#8212; I made that very clear to both sets of students.",0
750,"That’s an astonishing data point that a seven-year head start beats investing annually for the same amount for 30 years. What do you think of ideas that have been floated by people? The governor of New Jersey floated the idea of baby bonds that we gift every person born in the United States a $5,000 in an account that they can’t touch until they’re either 25 or &#8212; or for college. What are your thoughts on &#8212; on something like that?","Well, I do like that idea. I think it takes advantage of compounding. I don’t think it’s nearly enough. I mean, the statistics retirement savings for most people are &#8212; are pretty horrific. Nearly half of working age families don’t have any retirement savings. The median family between ages 32 and 61 have about $5,000 in retirement savings. The average working age, low-income, black, Hispanic or non-college graduates have no retirement savings.
And here’s a terrible statistic. Nine in 10 families in the top fifth of the income chain have retirement savings. Nine of 10 at the bottom fifth do not. So we need to do something. And if you earn between $7 to $13 a year or you earn &#8212; I mean, an hour or $10 or $12 an hour, which is about 40 percent of hourly workers do, but Social Security gets you about $9,000 a year. So you need retirement savings. It’s a real, real problem. And we don’t have a system that really takes care of that.
So, you know, what I suggest in the book is that compound interest is something that we can take advantage of and we don’t. We’re kind of blowing it as a country. And so right now Social Security is really based on what you put in as sort of related to what you get out. And so what I suggest is really putting into Social Security, gets capped at $137,000 a year. So I don’t suggest raising taxes, but I do suggest that high earners keep contributing to their retirement above 137,000. They get to keep 80 percent of it, and then you get the tax benefits of saving that so it goes into like a 401(k) account.
But the remaining 15 or 20 percent that they don’t get to keep it, it gets taken off the top now gets put into the account &#8211; the accounts of low earners and people just started working so they can take advantage of this compounded interest at an early age. They don’t have any savings outside of Social Security.
And so I suggest a 401(k)-type account for everyone funded by the higher earners, yet the higher earners really are getting the tax benefit of being able to put 80 percent of their amount they put in above 137 into their own tax advantaged saving. So it’s not really raising taxes, it’s giving them an advantage, but it’s also helping out those who need it the most.",0
751,"So let me make sure I understand this because this is kind of complicated, but it’s really very intriguing. Right now, your FICA contribution, your Social Security contributions top-out at about 137 a year. That number creeps up a tiny little bit each year adjusted for inflation. But effectively, if you are Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk, you top-out on January 1st. You’re done paying FICA for the year.
What &#8212; what you’re suggesting is everything above 137 or some percentage above 137, you get to put into a 401(k)-like funds over and above what your current limitations are. Eighty percent of what you move in goes in as if it’s a pre-tax investment, so when you take it out on the other end you’re not paying taxes. And 20 percent of it gets moved into a fund that gets put into individual investors, a similar 401(k)-like fund that they manage and &#8212; and you start doing this for &#8212; pick a year &#8212; 25-year-olds and younger. So in other words, you’re planning about something to fix the looming retirement crisis for 25-year-olds. Is that a fair assessment?","Yeah, so it could start earlier than &#8212; whenever you start working and start paying in, you get a big supplement. Everyone gets a 401(k) account, which I think everyone should have to take advantage of compounding. So it would go to both young people and low earners. It will go to both.",0
752,"That’s quite fascinating. Let’s talk a little bit about something that hasn’t gotten much press lately, and that’s what we do with immigrants in the United States. What advantages does the country get from a broader and more open immigration policy?","That’s a great question. And &#8212; and, of course, immigration is a controversial topic. But there’s one area that’s very clear, and we’re completely blowing that, and it’s skilled immigration. According to the business roundtable, we come in embarrassingly second to last among developed countries welcoming skilled immigrants. The only country we’re better at &#8212; at admitting skilled immigrants is Japan, and Japan literally discourages immigration. And not only that, you have to speak Japanese pretty much.
You know, the United States has a huge advantage. You know, English is the universal language of business and science. Second to last is a really bad spot for us for skilled immigration. What’s the big deal about that?
Well, you know, I disclosed in &#8220;Common Sense,&#8221; the book, that skilled immigrants are actually a natural resource. We make &#8212; if you want to put it that way &#8212; half a million to a million dollars of fund &#8212; each one of them in today’s dollars for everyone we take in. And with that is the math of &#8212; of those immigrants and their kids that’s today’s dollars of how much they contribute versus how much they get back from the government. So we make half a million to a million dollars for each skilled immigrant we take in.
We also get close to two jobs for people already here. So for every skilled immigrant we take in, they create two jobs for people already here. So we not only get a pile of money, we also get two jobs. It’s a &#8212; it’s a free gold mine. And I’ll tell you why we should be encouraging it.
Immigrants have founded 51 percent of U.S. startups over a billion dollars. They were twice as likely to start a business as natives as natives are. They’re responsible for a quarter of the productivity growth over the last 20 years. And immigrants or their children have founded 216 of the Fortune 500 companies, which is pretty amazing.",0
753,"There was a data point in the book that I found astonishing. Microsoft had done an internal study. And for each H-1B1 visa immigrant that they bring to the U.S. to work for them internally at Microsoft, they recreate four additional jobs. How on earth is that possible? That &#8212; that just sounds astonishing.","Well, you know, if you can get the best and brightest from around the world and &#8212; and hire someone like that, they need support and &#8212; and they create value. And so that was a quote from Bill Gates that they did a study that &#8212; at Microsoft. I said across the country it’s two jobs for every one we take in. And Microsoft, I guess, it’s such a high level that they’re taking in, they create four jobs. So it’s pretty, pretty exciting.
The only problem is we don’t encourage them to come. I said we came in second to last. Our H-1B1 program, which allowed skilled immigrants to come in is &#8212; is broken. It’s difficult. It takes a long time. It’s expensive. It’s very uncertain whether someone can stay. It’s very limited.
We exceed our cap within about five &#8212; three times our capital fly within the first five days of eligibility every year. So … … we’re discouraging them from coming in and we should encourage them.
Countries like Canada and Australia take anyone who will come who meet the government standards of skilled &#8212; you know, education and skill. And we don’t. We actually actively discourage them. And we actually have a better system than they do in some ways.",0
754,There was an &#8212; there was a article in Wired over the summer that discusses how Toronto has been feasting on tech workers that were frustrated with the U.S. H-1B visa programs and green card programs and general immigration programs. Are we letting some of our most value-creating and productive tech workers escape from America when we should really be much more welcoming and giving them a path to citizenship here?,"Yeah, I think that’s pretty clear. You know, I talked about all the money we would yield. I called it a free gold mine. It’s crazy. We’re &#8212; we’re throwing it away. I talked about all the money and the jobs we create by taking them in. But we actually have a system that should work even better than Canada and Australia. In Canada and Australia, they set government standards of who they’ll let in, you know, what &#8212; what kind of skilled labor. But that doesn’t mean they’re a good fit for a particular open job or that these people are ambitious. They just are people who meet government standards.
The way we work it with the H-1B is that there is an employer who actually wants to give you a job, so it’s very direct. In other words, it’s a one-to-one perfect match. And so I &#8212; I suggest that we use that system, that if an employer is willing to pay someone $60,000 or $70,000 a year, we can take as many of those as we want as long as that employer is willing to pay a 20 percent tax on top of that salary &#8212; in addition to that salary to the government.
You can take anyone you want. It ends up being cheaper than the current H-1B program. That’s very long. It’s much more certain. If you paid 20 percent tax for five years, you become eligible for a green card.
You know, it’s just unbelievable. I mean, countries that lack opportunity and political freedom and safety, things we have in space, they have what’s called a &#8220;brain drain.&#8221; And we should be a brain magnet. We have liberty, we have freedom, we have safety, we have opportunity. So, you know, the studies have shown that if &#8212; if you survey immigrants, we’re first choice. Second place is Germany and &#8212; and we beat them four to one. So we should take every right person, take all that money, take all those jobs that these skilled immigrants bring in.
I think it gets controversial because, you know, we have the Statue of Liberty. So very important (inaudible), you’re poor, you know, what about those seeking refuge or a better life? So I’m not addressing that with skilled immigrants.
But what I can say is this, we’re going to make so many money &#8212; so much money from taking, you know, a better skilled immigrant program that we can actually afford to take in for each skilled immigrant &#8212; one or two skilled immigrants, we can take eight or 10 unskilled immigrants, you know, and afford to take them in or we can bring in eight or 10 of kids who are already here out of childhood poverty. So we can do either one of those things.
I don’t want to get into an argument, which is a better thing to do, bring in more skilled immigrants to give refuge to people who want a better life here in our country. It’s been very important to our country and I think that’s important or to help the people already here. I don’t want to get into the argument what we should do with all the free money that we get by bringing skilled immigrants. All I argued is we should take the free money.",0
755,"What do you do with the 20 percent surcharge over hiring? What &#8212; where does that pool of capital go? Does that help the unskilled immigrants? Does that help? Any time there’s a big pile of cash, people get their eyes on it. What do you do with that money?","Yeah. Well, I would &#8212; I would put it into job training for the people already here. I &#8212; I would help, you know, employee is already here. Obviously, with the 20 percent premium that you’ll have to pay for a skilled immigrant, you would hire someone anybody who’s here so that you don’t have to pay the 20 percent extra. So you’re really taking in people that you can’t get here already.
But there are people who need more training here. That’s been a big problem. As we know, education is the answer. Job training is the answer to people who aren’t earning enough here. And we can take that 20 percent and put it to very good use in that area. That’s what I would suggest.",0
756,"How do you deal with some of the structural racism that’s built institutionally into United States that that Wired article I mentioned made reference to a number of programmers and other tech people who are people of color, and this was in both the Virginia part of the country outside of D.C. and outside of San Francisco. They felt that they were harassed by police because they look different even though both areas are filled with immigrants working in tech. And when the opportunity came to go to Toronto, they &#8212; they jumped on it. How big an issue is this?","Right. Well, in Toronto they &#8212; they had the chance for citizenship that they &#8212; they didn’t have here under our current system, so that’s part of it. And this has been a problem across the world. You know, it’s happening in Europe where people who look a little different aren’t very well-absorbed into the local economies.
We are the &#8212; still the biggest melting pot in the world. So with all our problems, we still have it better than everyone else. And we can provide that opportunity to immigrants here. They still want to come here. It’s still &#8212; we’re still the preference.
Second place, only a quarter of the people want to go to. There’s 147 million skilled immigrants who want to come here. So yes, there are problems. I think we have less than many other countries, particularly in Europe. And I think we’re a bigger melting pot than any other country in the world. So I &#8212; I &#8212; I acknowledge the issues. I’m not going to argue with them. I’m saying we’re &#8212; in comparison, we’re still in pretty good shape. We’re &#8212; we’re still welcoming, in general.",0
757,"Let’s pivot to your bread and butter &#8212; value investing. You famously gave away the magic formula, which has a wonderful long-term track record. But as we’ve seen over the past five years, value investing has struggled. What’s going on in in value land?","Well, you know, I gave a speech, you know, in the last year called this &#8220;value investing debt.&#8221; And my answer was yes, no, maybe and I don’t care.
(LAUGHTER)
And the reason for that is it really depends on how you define value. If you define it like Russell or Morningstar where it’s low price book, low price sales investing, it’s had a tough time, an &#8212; an extraordinary time.
Last five years, growth &#8212; the way they define it at Morningstar or Russell &#8212; has outperformed value by 11 percent per year. Last three years, it’s 17 percent per year growth outperforming value. The last 12 months, it’s about 43 percent. These are phenomenal numbers. These are numbers bigger than during the five years before the top of the Internet bubble. These are slightly bigger, slightly bigger to discrepancy between growth and value.
So your question is &#8212; is very good. If you define value like we do, which is figure out what a business is worth and pay a lot less, that’s what I define as value investing. And, you know, Ben Graham would say leave a large margin of safety, then that’s never really going to go out of style. We &#8212; we look at companies like we’re a private equity firm. No private equity firm buys a business because it’s a low price book or little price sales. They’re really looking at cash flows. OK. So while in a period like this where anything that’s somewhat out of favor, even though it’s not low price book, low price sales, they rhyme together. And if people are willing to pay growth at any price, then that’s not going to be a good period for any style of value investing.
But if &#8212; and the question is is value investing dead or is it going to continue, it comes down to how you define it. And people will always come back to valuation. It’s based on cash flows and how much those cash flows are going to grow over time. As Buffett would always say, growth and value were tied at the hip. They’re part of the same equation, figuring out value. So once again, we’re talking about definitions.",0
758,"So one of the interesting …
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)","OK. So while in a period like this where anything that’s somewhat out of favor, even though it’s not low price book, low price sales, they rhyme together.

They’re part of the same equation, figuring out value. So once again, we’re talking about definitions.",0
759,"I don’t want to call it post mortems, but analyses on why growth has been doing so well relative to value over the past 10 years, is that in an era of low inflation and very low rates? Capital intensive industries like tech and growth, it’s a very inexpensive input to them versus high inflation or higher rate regimes. Value is presented an opportunity to shine because it apparently needs less capital. What &#8212; what are your thoughts on those sort of analyses of &#8212; of value versus growth these days?","Right. Well, that’s a great question. And so if you’re talking about low price book investing, of course, it’s &#8212; it’s very relevant. If you’re talking about cash flow-oriented investing, it gets a little bit more nuanced. So let me describe it this way.
For many, many years before the last decade or so, stocks stuff that were low price book, low price sales tended to outperform the market for a period of 30, 40 years. And what that meant is that if you were buying a company close to its book value, meaning you aren’t giving much of a premium to the value of the business underlying the purchase, then if you put a bucket of company selling at low price book, you were tending to get more than your fair share of companies that were out of favor. So it correlated well with more than your fair share of companies that were out of favor and maybe too out of favor and so you could get an excess return.
Same way as momentum has worked for 30, 40 years, not just in this country, but across the globe. Let’s say it didn’t work for the next two years. It could be that it’s just cyclically out of favor. It works over the long-term, you just have to be patient or it could be momentum doesn’t work over the next two years because the trade has become crowded and it’s degraded. And that’s why it didn’t work.
Two years from now I would know the answer. Is it &#8212; is momentum just cyclically out of favor or it was the trade now because it’s not so hard to figure out a stock used to be down here and now it’s up here? Has it become crowded and degraded because everyone knows about it?
Two years from now I would know the answer. So the way I’d answer your question is this. Low price book, low price sales momentum are all things that, in the past, had correlated with good returns. We really look for causation. And since stocks for ownership here is a business and we’re valuing them just like a private equity investor would, OK, and that’s based on cash flows, you know, are the intangibles earning money? They’re not earning money. Those are questions that translated the cash flow and how much am I paying for that cash flow and how much am I paying for that growth.
And so, you know, what we’re looking for is valuation of a business, taking all those things into account and trying to buy it at a discount. And it’s possible the market doesn’t recognize that. And, you know, if you look at the last year, if you bought every company that lost money in 2019, 2020 is &#8212; is a little messed up because of COVID and the second quarter had weird earnings, so let’s just look at the companies that lost money in 2019.
If you bought every company that lost money in 2019 that had a market cap over $1 billion, and so they’re about 261 of those and you bought every single one of those companies, you’ll be up 65 percent so far this year. OK? So, you know, in that kind of market, that’s kind of frothy at that end where people are going to say, hey, this company is going to be the next Google, Microsoft or Amazon. I don’t think the froth is in the Google, Amazon and &#8212; Amazon. Those are some of the best businesses we’ve ever seen in our lifetime.
To a large extent, they &#8212; they &#8212; I don’t quibble with their valuations. I actually &#8212; we own a big chunk of those companies. We &#8212; we think they’re great businesses. But there are hundreds of companies with &#8212; that rhyme with them. So it’s really not looking at indexes or how do we classify value and growth, it’s really looking stock by stock, valuing them try to buy at a discount. And that’s causation.
And so that causation might not be popular in the next year or two, but I’m not going to stop doing that. That’s what stocks are (inaudible) shares the businesses. So that’s the best way I can answer your question.
We’re looking for causation not correlation. We’re not looking for that low price book, low price sales momentum of correlated. No private equity firm buys it.
If I came to you and said, hey, listen, I have this real estate strategy, I’m just going to buy all the houses that were up the most in the last three months.
(LAUGHTER)
You kind of look at me like I was nuts. And so although it’s correlated with good returns in the past, that’s not what I would continue doing even though it’s correlated. I’m looking for causation. That’s where I can put it.",0
760,"So let me throw a correlation/causation curve ball at you. I have seen a number of studies over the years that point out that relative to their peers that don’t do big stock buybacks, the company is doing share buybacks tend to outperform. Is that a correlation issue? Hey, they have all the extra cash and, therefore, they’re good companies to begin with so they could do buy backs or there is some causal relationship between reducing the outstanding share account and that makes your earnings appear better. What is the advantage or not of borrowing cheap money to buy shares back?","Right. Well, what you’re saying is true, and I &#8212; I haven’t looked at the studies. But if what you’re saying is true that buyback stock has correlated with good returns in the past, I would call that a correlation. Causation has to do with smart managements who only buy back stock when it’s selling at a discount to what they think it’s worth and they’re right. So in other words, there’s nothing … … inherently good or bad with buybacks. Some are smart when you’re buying it below what the business is worth, and some are not so smart when you’re &#8212; let’s say borrowing money to overpay for your own stock. And so both of those things are true, and I wouldn’t want to look at anything that’s happened in the past and say, oh, it’s correlated with this or that. I would look at stock by stock and see if their buybacks were made good prices relative to my assessment of value or whether we made it too high prices with borrowed money. And so they’re totally different things, so I &#8212; I wouldn’t put any weight into any study that they just looked at generically companies that buy stocks back. There’s nothing inherently good or bad about it. It depends what price they pay.",0
761,"Quite interesting. We’ve noticed a tendency among some of the companies you’ve referenced like Google or Microsoft or Amazon or what have you that it’s become less of a competitive group of firms fighting it out for clients or customer and more of the winner-take-all situation. What are your thoughts on those sort of winners and losers, what Buffett describes as companies with impenetrable moats?","Yeah. I mean, we own a lot of those businesses. You know, we have a fund that looks &#8212; you know, buys the S&amp;P 500, all 500 stocks of the S&amp;P 500, but overweights companies that we think are cheap and underweights those so with those all 500, but starts with the S&amp;P index, which is market cap-weighted and then overweights companies that we think are cheap and underweights those that we think are expensive by a little bit so it doesn’t have too much tracking error. It’s, you know, sort of an index tilt.
And we have overweighted almost all those companies that you’re describing. They are some of the best businesses in the history that we’ve ever seen. We haven’t seen anything like this before &#8212; the power &#8212; and I think the Internet brings this power to these businesses. And these are moats that are very tough to beat. And so what you’re suggesting is true is true.
These are great businesses. They are dominating. It’s very hard to break into them. And so I don’t actually have a solution for shall we break them up, shall we not break them up. As an investor, I’m investing in them.",0
762,Right. You want to be on the other side of the moat in other words?,"Right. If you really look at the cash flows that &#8212; and &#8212; and the stability of the cash flows, the growth prospects for the cash flows, these businesses are priced reasonably or cheaply depending on which one. So that’s not where the froth of the market is. The froth in the market is in the hundreds of companies that I was talking about before, that people will think will rhyme with the next Amazon, Google and Microsoft. And there just can’t be hundreds of companies that do that. So I think that’s where the comeuppance will be.
And so when you talked about the difficulty of value investing, that fund just overweights what we think is cheap, according to our definition of value, and underweights has beaten the market. So even in a very tough period for value, it’s not like the principals don’t work, they do work. But when you go long/short and short some of these names that are losing money are trading at hundreds of times that people think will be the next Amazon and Google, those, I think, are writing at very high prices and will have their comeuppance and so at least I hope so. And that’s &#8212; that’s where I think the problem.",0
763,"So you deal with &#8212; you manage money professionally, you deal with allocators and others. You’re defining value in a way that’s somewhat different than the way many value investors &#8212; many less successful value investors have done so. What do you say to those people who are ready to throw in the towel on value and think now is the time to jump into growth?","Well, look, I don’t buy if I said the traditional definitions of value and growth. The reason that we overlap with value some of the times it’s because we’re certainly not growth at any price, you know, throw away the &#8212; the rule book and just buy growth at any price. So sometimes we correlate closely with company &#8212; other companies that are out of favor. And &#8212; and so those even Russell and Morningstar will put us in the &#8212; the &#8212; either the &#8212; the blend category or the value category. That’s usually where we are. We’re certainly not growth at any price.
But I do think if you’re asking me whether I think the traditional definition of value will come back at some point, yes, I do. I think it’s gone to an extreme at this point. I think it’ll come back. I don’t really care if it does or not because it’s not our definition, but I do think it’ll come back.
I think the &#8212; you should &#8212; you &#8212; a lot of managers or allocators view traditional value as an asset class, meaning, hey, I should have some exposure here. It zigs and zags differently than the market, the returns. And at some point, they’ll have their day in the sun. And so I think people will continue to allocate there, but in a limited &#8212; a more limited way because people change what works, and it’s clearly not been working traditional value.",0
764,"So imagine us five or 10 years off in the future if I were to ask you, hey, what was the one indicator, what was the one data point that was a signifier that value had come back, what particular data point or variable might that be?","That’s a great question that I don’t have a great answer for, mostly because what I said about the definition of value. So I guess what I would be looking for is companies that borrow a lot of money and lose money, don’t have and &#8212; and aren’t the next Google and Amazon. There’ll be some winners in that group, but most of them will have their comeuppance where eventually you have to earn money. That’s where I think of some of those companies have their comeuppance where, as I said, the money losers were 65 percent so far this year.
If those companies saw &#8212; a bunch of those companies have their comeuppance, I would say that, you know, there’s a chance for relative performance on &#8212; on companies that aren’t like those, but otherwise …",0
765,So &#8212; so leverage …,… can’t answer it soon.,0
766,"Right. So leverage low&#8211; low profitable companies, some people would call that low-quality versus high-quality. Is that a ratio worth &#8212; worth considering?","You know, I &#8212; I &#8212; I hate making generalizations, so I’m not trying to avoid your questions, but we really look at the market …",0
767,I know and I’m …,… stop by …,0
768,… I’m trying to pin you down with a really general backwards-looking future forecast.,"Yeah. No, we look at it (inaudible) &#8212; no, a lot of people asked that question. It’s a reasonable question, I just don’t have a great answer because we’re looking at things stock by stock and very hard to make generalizations about that, especially if &#8212; as I keep saying, we have different definitions.",0
769,"So for the record, let’s get your best definition of the sort of value companies that you think have the best risk-adjusted growth potential. What are the data points that you’re looking at today not for a specific name but, you know, I’m giving you an opportunity to restate the magic formula.","Right. So what I would say is right now the pre-tax cash flow yields of the S&amp;P 500 is about four percent, a little under four percent. So there are companies that have less than a four percent yield, but much higher growth rate than the S&amp;P in general. And there are companies that have a much higher yield, you know, five or six or seven percent that have at least as good, if not better, fundamentals and growth rate than the S&amp;P 500. So both of those are relative values.
There aren’t a lot of companies out there that are super cheap right now. If you look historically, things are expensive. Obviously, that has something to do with interest rates being lower than normal. It has something to do with the alternatives not being there for diversification. And so stocks being one of the only games in town, so it certainly has something to do with that.
And if you told me that rates would stay permanently low, which I just don’t know, then on an absolute basis we could make some nice money from here. Otherwise, I’m in a lucky position of people give me money and say I want to put it in the stock market. What’s the smartest way to do that? And so what we’re sticking to our companies that maybe yield a little less than the S&amp;P, but have much better growth prospects, much more secure earnings, stream great franchises, so we’re willing to buy those. We’re also going to buy companies that we can get it much higher free cash flow yields than the market that have at least as good growth, if not better and better operating fundamentals. So both of those are areas that we look at and that’s how we would define at least a relative value right now, and I think they could provide good value if rates stayed as low.",0
770,"Sounds good to me. I know we only have you for a few more minutes, so let me jump to my favorite questions we ask all of our guest in our speed round. And let’s start with what are you streaming these days. Give us your favorite Netflix, Amazon Prime or &#8212; or whatever podcast you might be listening to.","Well, the two I’ve been watching lately, one is The Mindy Project because it’s funny, and we can all use that now. And the other is The Americans because it’s just great drama. So I guess a lot of people are streaming during COVID and, you know, it’s been a horrible thing for so many people. But those are my two suggestions there.",0
771,"I’m going to put those both on my list. Tell us about your early mentors, who &#8212; who guided your career, who affected the direction you move professionally.","Well, you know, I have to start with my dad. He was a businessman. He was a shoe manufacturer and I learned ethics and actually how business works on a day-to-day basis at the dinner table. He always shares with us. I got to work with him first couple of summers. And, you know, I &#8212; someone I truly admire. He’s still with us and, you know, I &#8212; I &#8212; I love him a lot, a great mentor.
And then there’s, of course, Graham and Buffett. You know, I went to Wharton. I was learning about efficient markets. It didn’t make much sense to me. I read an article about Ben Graham then started reading everything that he wrote and everything about him. And then, of course, he mentored Warren Buffett who made that little twist buying a good business cheap that made him one of the richest people in the world.,
And both of those people shared what they learned with others, and &#8212; and that’s one of the reasons I write, one of the reasons I teach is because of their example. And so they have been great early mentors for me.",0
772,Let’s talk about books. Tell us some of your favorite books and &#8212; and what are you reading currently.,"Well, two most recent books I read, one was called &#8220;The Splendid and the Vile,&#8221; by Erik Larsen. It’s about Churchill’s first year in the office which, of course, when things &#8212; everything was going wrong, they put up an office days before it looked like England was going to fall. So how he handled that was really amazing to read and great, great, great book.
I love anything about Benjamin Franklin, so I &#8212; I just read a latest thing from Gordon Wood, &#8220;The Americanization of Ben Franklin,&#8221; so I enjoyed that very much. And if you haven’t read much about Ben Franklin, that’s what I would suggest.
And then I read a book called &#8220;Chasing My Cure,&#8221; by Dr. David Fajgenbaum who actually cured himself of a orphan disease that no one had lived from before. And he was in medical school when he was diagnosed with this disease. They didn’t know what was wrong with him, and it was going to be fatal in a few years. And the book is called &#8220;Chasing My Cure,&#8221; and it shows how he actually cured himself and lots of other people that have this disease. And it was fascinating and now he’s attacking COVID in the same way. He’s looking for existing drugs that may act well on something that doesn’t have a drug of its own. And so he’s been working on that. And it was a very inspiring book, so that’s called &#8220;Chasing My Cure.&#8221; And &#8212; and believe it or not, it’s a page turner.",0
773,Sounds fascinating. What sort of advice would you give to a recent college graduate who was considering a career in asset management?,"Well, I don’t want to be cliché, but if you’re lucky enough to find something that you’re passionate about, that you can do for a living, that’s a gift. Buffett calls it &#8220;dancing to work every day.&#8221;
And the only people I would suggest that go into it are people who feel that way, to go into this business just for the money, you know, and &#8212; and many aspects of it pay &#8212; pay well. I don’t think it’s a great choice, but if you really love it, you can help a lot of people, which they’re investing and you can do good things with the money that you do earn if you’re successful at it. So I highly recommend it, but really only if you’re passionate, you love the work. So that would be my best advice.
Pick something else. There’s a lot of ways you can contribute to society that don’t involve asset management. So if you love it, I’m all for it. If you’re doing it for the money, pick something else.",0
774,"Our final question, what do you know about the world of investing today that you wish you knew when you started out 30 or so years ago?","Sure. Well, I got into investing, reading Ben Graham. And &#8212; and one of the first articles I read were what Warren Buffett would call &#8220;cigar butt investing,&#8221; you know, buying net-net stocks. And I actually wrote an article with some of my classmates &#8212; my master’s thesis that was published in the Journal of Portfolio Management on net-nets. And they worked pretty well.
And, you know, as I said, Buffett made that little twist that made him one of the richest people in the world even though he’s a student of Graham. He said, &#8220;If I can buy good business cheap even better, quality matters a lot even more now than it did 30 years ago.&#8221;
You need to invest in a good business. If you think about investing as not trading, but buying companies you’re going to hold for a long time, of course, you want to be in a good business that has a good franchise and grow for a long period of time. Of course, it’s an art to figuring that out. But to the extent that you can concentrate on those areas and also look for bargains, you know, combination of things, you don’t want to overpay for those things. But if you can pay a reasonable or a cheap price for those things, concentrating on quality is a key that I &#8212; I learned probably, I started about 37 or eight years ago. I probably learned it about 30 years ago, and I &#8212; and that’s the most important lesson I’ve learned in that period of time.",0
775,How did you first get interested in the stock market.,"Well, I grew up in the 
		1950s.  I started caddying when I was 11.  So the
<img align=""right"" alt=""PETER Lynch"" src=""../art/lynch.gif""/>would have been 1955 and in that part -- the '50s were a great decade for the
stock market.  I caddied a very nice club out in west Newton, had a lot of
people, corporate executives, and some of these were buying stocks and I
remember them talking about stocks and they mentioned the names and I'd look in
the paper and look at it a month later, a year later, and I noticed they were
goin' up.  And I said, ""Gee, this makes a lot of sense.""  And so I watched it.
I didn't have any money to invest, but I remember the stock market being very
strong in the 1950s and some people, not everybody, but a lot of people on the
golf course talking about it.",0
776,What was your first stock?,"Well, when I got a caddie scholarship to college.  It was actually a
partial scholarship, a Frances Wimen Scholarship, a financial aid
scholarship, but it was  thousand dollars to go to Boston College and they gave
me a $300 scholarship and I got to earn over $700 a year caddying.  So I was
able to build up a little bit of money  and I worked also during the winters.
So while I was in college I did a little study on the freight industry, the air
freight industry.  And I looked at this company called Flying Tiger.  And I
actually put a thousand dollars in it and I remember I thought this air cargo
was going to be a thing of the future.  And I bought it and it got really lucky
because it went up for another reason.  The Vietnam War started and they
basically hauled a lot of troops to  Vietnam in airplanes and the stock went
up, I think, nine- or ten-fold and I had my first ten bagger.  I started
selling it, I think, at 20 and 30 and 40, sold all the way up to 80 and helped
pay for graduate school.  So I almost had a Flying Tiger graduate school
fellowship.",0
777,"You originated the expression ""four bagger"", ""five bagger"" et
cetera.  What's that mean exactly?","I've always been a great lover of baseball.  I mean if you grew up in
Boston, you know that the last time we won the World Series, Babe Ruth pitched
for us.  It was 1918.  So it's been a long drought here.  So I've always loved
baseball and the ten bagger is two home-runs and a double.  It's you run around
a lot, so it's very exciting.",0
778,That's pretty good.,"Excellent.  You don't need a lot in your lifetime.  You only need a few
good stocks in your lifetime.  I mean how many times do you need a stock to go
up ten-fold to make a lot of money?  Not a lot.",0
779,Was that your secret?,"Well, I think the secret is if you have a lot of stocks, some will do
mediocre, some will do okay, and if one of two of 'em go up big time, you
produce a fabulous result.  And I think that's the promise to some people.
Some stocks go up 20-30 percent and they get rid of it and they hold onto the
dogs.  And it's sort of like watering the weeds and cutting out the flowers.
You want to let the winners run.  When the fun ones get better, add to 'em, and
that one winner, you basically see a few stocks in your lifetime, that's all
you need.  I mean stocks are out there.  When I ran Magellan, I wrote a book.
I think I listed over a hundred stocks that went up over ten-fold when I ran
Magellan and I owned thousands of stocks.  I owned none of these stocks.  I
missed every one of these stocks that went up over ten-fold.  I didn't own a
share of them.  And I still managed to do well with Magellan.  So there's lots
of stocks out there and all you need is a few of 'em.  So that's been my
philosophy.  You have to let the big ones make up for your mistakes.",0
780,"When you first went to Fidelity, what was the market like?","Well, after the great rush of the '50s, the market did brilliantly and
everybody says, ""Wow, looking backwards, this would be a great time to get in.""
So a lot of people got in in the early '60s and in the mid-60s.  The market
peaked in '65-66 around a thousand, and that's when I came.  I was a summer
student at Fidelity in 1966.  There were 75 applicants for three jobs at
Fidelity, but I caddied for the president for eight years.  So that was the
only job interview I ever took.  It was sort of a rigged deal, I think.  I
worked there the summer of '66 and I remember the market was close to a
thousand in 1966, and in 1982, 16 years later, it was 777.  So we had  a long
drought after that.  So the people were concerned about the stock market early
in the '50s.  They kept watching and watching, not investing.  It started to go
up dramatically and they finally caved in and bought big time in the mid-60s
and got the peak.",0
781,"So people got in at the wrong time, in effect?","A lot of people got in at the wrong time.  A lot of people did very well
and some people said, ""This is it.  I'll never get back in again.""  And they
maybe meant it, but they probably got back in again anyway.",0
782,How much did you make on your first job at Fidelity?,"I was paid, $16,000 a year. I was an analyst.  I was the textile
analyst, the metals analysts, and I remember the second year I got a raise to
$17,000.  That was great, you know.",0
783,Did you get other job offers?,"I was in ROTC studies, I spent two years in the Army and I did two
years of graduate school and in, a business at Wharton School of Finance,
University of Pennsylvania.  So I was about 25 when I joined Fidelity.",0
784,How old were you when you took over Magellan?,"That was 1977, so I guess I was 33.",0
785,What kind of fund was Magellan?,"It was a small aggressive capital appreciation fund.  Magellan Fund
basically started in the early '60s.  In the name, it was an international
fund, but right after it started in 1963, they put sort of a barrier and a
heavy tax on foreign investing.  So it did very little foreign investing.  It
had the ability to do it, but there was very little interest then.  There was a
big penalty.  So even though it was Magellan Fund, it was primarily a domestic
fund.  And when I took over in May of 1977, the fund was $20 million.",0
786,And that was your first portfolio managing job?,"That's correct.  I was director research in 1974.  I still
continued to be an analyst, and then May of 1977 I took over Magellan Fund.",0
787,"But the market really didn't do much between '77 and '82, between
the beginning of that bull market, and yet your fund performed quite
spectacularly.  What do you do?","Well, I think flexibility is one of the key things.  I mean I would buy
companies that had unions.  I would buy companies that were in the steel
industry.  I'd buy textile companies.  I always thought there was good
opportunities everywhere and, researched my stocks myself.  I mean Taco Bell
was one of my first stock I bought.  I mean the people wouldn't look at a small
restaurant company.  So I think it was just looking at different companies and
I always thought if you looked at ten companies, you'd find one that's
interesting, if you'd look at 20, you'd find two, or if you look at hundred
you'll find ten.  The person that turns over the most rocks wins the game.  And
that's always been my philosophy.",0
788,How did Magellan begin to make a name for itself in '82?,"Well,  the first three years I ran Magellan, I think one-third of
the shares were redeemed.  I mean there was very little interest.  People
didn't care.  The market was doing okay and Magellan was doing well, but people
were sort of recovering from their losses, so they from the '50s and '60s, and
so literally one-third of the shares were redeemed the first three years I ran
it.  And in 1982, the market started to pick up.  It bought 'em in August of
'82, and from then on a lot of interest came back in the market in '83 and '84.
Magellan had the best five-year record in 1982 and the best five-year record in
1983 and people tend to look, the press and the media and the newspapers, tend
to look at who's had a good record and Magellan was there.",0
789,Tell about the first time you were on Ruckeyser.,"Well, 1982, I think it was the market had just gone over a
thousand maybe a week or two before that.  So this would have been, I think,
October of '82 and Chrysler was my biggest position and the stock, I think, was
10 and I recommended Chrysler and I remember I had, ah -- I had people who
said, ""Gee, we thought you were interesting.""  These were relatives of mine.
""But how could you ever recommend Chrysler?  Don't you know they're going
bankrupt?""  I remember friends of mine and relatives saying, ""That sound crazy
to me.""  So it worked out fine.",0
790,"Chart the growth of the fund in the '80s, just for chronology.","Well, the fund was not very big in 1982, even though I had ran it for
five years.  And in '80-- end of '82 when the market really started to come in
and people started to look to the future, I think it was April of '83 it passed
one billion.  That was a big number.  I remember that number has a lot of zeros
and it's kind of a magic number.  So I remember that point and people just
continued to be interested in the market and  these were lots of individuals
coming.  This was not people putting in four million at the time or three
million.  It was lots of two-, and three- and five-thousand-investments coming
in.  And it was steady.  It wasn't a torrent.  It just was there every day.",0
791,"Was it becoming more famous?  Wasn't it on ""Jeopardy"", for
instance?","Yeah.  At some point in time I remember -- I didn't watch the show.  I
always liked ""Jeopardy"", but I remember my wife watched the show and somebody
was saying ""What's the fund that was named after an explorer.""  And all the
people, they all hit the button at the same time on ""Jeopardy"" and they knew it
was Magellan.  So, I guess it became more famous then, but there wasn't that
much coverage.  I mean today I think <u>The Wall Street Journal</u> has three
full-time reporters covering the mutual fund industry.  They had none in the
early '80s.  So the coverage was really basically Wall Street, Louis
Ruckheyser, <u>Barron's</u>, a little bit in <u>The New York Times</u>
every quarter.  There was not coverage of the mutual fund industry.  It was
really coverage of stocks.  And, you know, occasionally, ah, <u>Forbes</u> or
<u>Fortune</u> or a periodical would write an article, but there wasn't very
much  interest even in the '80s.",0
792,What caused that to change?,"Well, I think the great decade of the '80s and people thinking that, you
know, ""There's a lot of publicity on the Social Security System not gonna make
it,"" and a lot of pension plans.  I mean people used to retire and they'd say,
""Right now I'm going to get half my last year's salary for the rest of my life,
or 60 percent.  I don't have to worry about it.""  Now a lot of people are given
their entire pension plan, the most important financial asset they ever got,
and they said, ""Okay, sweetheart, it's yours.  Take care of it.""  Or there's no
pension plan.  So today people have to think about their future.  They're
worried about Social Security and they may have to do their own pension or they
already have been given their pension and say, ""You manage it.""  So I think
there's -- you have to become finally literate today.",0
793,"Was your success part of reason why the press, et cetera, began to
look at mutual funds more carefully?","Well, I think the fact the fund went up, I mean that was the key.
If I'd had gone down, I'd have had to dye my hair and grow a beard and move to
Fiji.  It was just the fact it went up, people made a lot of money and there
was a lot of word-of-mouth.  I mean it was people saying that ""Investing is
good,"" and ""We should put some of our money aside and put so much in
quarterly.""  And I think the IRA was invented and there was a lot of things
that were to encourage people to save.",0
794,"If had put a thousand dollars in Magellan on the day you took it
over, how much would I have reaped on the day you retired?","Well, if somebody invested a thousand dollars in Magellan on May 31st,
1977, the day I left, the thousand would have been $28,000, --May 31st 13 years
later, 1990.",0
795,Talk about the change in '86-87.,"Well, I remember in my career you'd say to somebody you worked in the
investment business.  They'd say, ""That's interesting.  Do you sail?  What do
you think of the Celtics?""  I mean it would just go right to the next subject.
If you told them you were a prison guard, they would have been interested.
They would have had some interest in that subject, but if you said you were in
the investment business, they said, ""Oh, terrific.  Do your children go to
school?""  It just went right to the next subject.  You could have been a leper,
you know, and been much more interesting.  So that was sort of the attitude in
the '60s and '70s.",0
796,Where were you when the Crash of '87 came?,"Well, I was very well prepared for the Crash of 1987.  -- my wife and I
took our first vacation in eight years and we left on Thursday in October and
I think that day the market went down 55 points and we went to Ireland, the
first trip we'd ever been there.  And then on Friday, because of the time
difference, we'd almost completed the day and I called and the market was down
115.  I said to Carolyn, ""If the market goes down on Monday, we'd better go
home.""  And ""We're already here for the weekend.  So we'll spend the weekend.""
So it went down 508 on Monday, so I went home.  So in two business days I had
lost a third of my fund.  So I figured at that rate, the week would have been a
rough week.  So I went home.  Like I could do something about it.  I mean it's
like, you know, if there was something I could do.  I mean there I was -- but I
think if people called up and they said, ""What's Lynch doing,"" and they said,
""Well, he's on the eighth hole and  he's every par so far, but he's in a trap,
this could be a triple bogey,"" I mean I think that's not what they wanted to
hear.  I think they wanted to hear I'd be there lookin' over -- I mean there's
not a lot you can do when the market's in a cascade but I got home quick as I
could.",0
797,Why did the Crash of '87 happen?,"Well, I think people had not analyzed '87 very well.  I think you
really have to put it in perspective.  1982, the market's 777.  It's all the
way to '86.  You have the move to 1700.  In four years -- the market moves from
777 to 1700 in four years.  Then in none months it puts on a thousand points.
So it puts on a thousand points in four years, then puts on another thousand
points in the next nine months.  So in August of 1987 it's 2700.  It's gone up
a thousand points in nine months.  Then it falls a thousand points in two
months, 500 points the last day.  So if the market got sideways at 1700, no one
would have worried, but it went up a thousand in nine-ten months and then a
thousand in two months, and half of it in one day, you would have said.... ""The
world's over.""  It was the same price.  So it was really a question of the
market just kept going up and up and it just went to such an incredible high
price by historic, price earnings multiple load, dividend yields, all the other
statistics, but people forget that basically it was unchanged in 12 months.  If
you looked at September, 1986 to October '87, the market was unchanged.  It had
a thousand point up and a thousand points down and they only remember the down.
They thought, ""Oh, my goodness, this is the crash.  It's all over.  It's going
to go to 200 and I'm going to selling apples and pencils,"" you know.  But it
wasn't.  It was a very unique phenomenon because companies were doing fine.
Just, you know, you'd call up a company and say, ""We can't figure it out.
We're doin' well.  Our orders are good.  Our balance sheet's good.""  ""We just
announced we're gonna buy some of our stock.  We can't figure out why it's good
down so much.""",0
798,Was that the most scared you ever were in your career?,"'87 wasn't that scary because I concentrate on fundamentals.  I call up
companies.  I look at their balance sheet.  I look at their business.  I look
at the environment.  The decline was kinda scary and you'd tell yourself, ""Will
this infect the basic consumer?  Will this drop make people stop buying cars,
stop buying houses, stop buying appliances, stop going to restaurants?""  And
you worried about that.",0
799,What was so scary about 1990?,"Well, 1990 was a situation where I think it's almost exactly six years
ago approximately now.  In the summer of 1990, the market's around 3000.
Economy's doing okay.  And Saddam Hussein decides to walk in and invade Kuwait.
So we have invasion of Kuwait and President Bush sends 500,000 troops to Saudi
to protect Saudi Arabia.  There's a very big concern about, you know, ""Are we
going to have another Vietnam War?""  A lot of serious military people said,
""This is going to be a terrible war.""  Iraq has the fourth largest army in the
world.  They really fought very well against Iran.  These people are tough.
This is going to be a long, awful thing.  So people were very concerned about
that, but, in addition, we had a very major banking crisis.  All the major New
York City banks, Bank America, the real cornerstone of this country were really
in trouble.  And this is a lot different than if W.T. Grant went under or Penn
Central went under.  Banking is really tight.  And you had to hope that the
banking system would hold together and that the Federal Reserve understood that
Citicorp, Chase, Chemical, Manufacturers Hanover, Bank of America were very
important to this country and that they would survive.  And then we had a
recession.  Unlike '87 you called companies, in 1990 you called companies and
say, ""Gee, our business is startin' to slip.  Inventories are startin' to pile
up.  We're not doing that well.""  So you really at that point in time had to
belief the whole thing would hold together, that we wouldn't have a major war.
You really had to have faith in the future of this country in 1990.  In '87,
the fundamentals were terrific and it was -- it was like one of those three for
two sales at the K-Mart.  Things were marked down.  It was the same story.",0
800,"Is there so much pressure because you're handling so much money for
other people?","It wasn't the pressure.  I loved the job.  I mean I worked for the best
company in the world.  I get paid extremely well.  We had free coffee.  I mean
it's a great place to work.  I could see any company I wanted to see.  I didn't
have to, say, get permission to go visit companies I California or Indiana.  I
just -- lot of freedom, a lot of responsibility.  The pressure wasn't it.  It
was just too much time.  I was working six days a week and that wasn't even
enough.",0
801,"Were you surprised by the outpouring in the wake of your
retirement?","I was really shocked at people's response and all the networks and news
overseas and all around the world that it was such a big deal.  I mean I was
amazed by it. I could write five letters a day for the next seven years to get
back to the people that wrote thanking me or wishing me the best and literally
maybe my secretary screened me from the nasty ones, but I don't remember
anybody saying, ""You god.  I just got in yesterday and you left.""  I mean there
were all these very nice notes saying, ""You're doing the right thing.  I'm very
happy about it,"" and ...",0
802,"Tell the story about your wife stumbling on a big stock for you in
the supermarket.","I had a great luck company called Hanes.  They test marketed a product
called L'Eggs in Boston and I think in Columbus, Ohio, maybe three or four
markets.  And Carolyn, ah, brought this product home and she was buying and she
said, ""It's great.""  And she almost got a black belt in shopping.  She's a very
good shopper.  If we hadn't had these three kids, she now -- when Beth finally
goes off to college, I think we'll be able to resume her training.  But she's a
very good shopper and she would buy these things.  She said, ""They're really
great.""  And I did a little bit of research.  I found out the average woman
goes to the supermarket or a drugstore once a week.  And they go a woman's
specialty store or department store once every six weeks.  And all the good
hosiery, all the good pantyhose is being sold in department stores.  They were
selling junk in the supermarkets.  They were selling junk in the drugstores.
So this company came up with a product.  They rack-jobbed it, they had all the
sizes, all the fits, a down they never advertised price.  They just advertised
""This fits.  You'll enjoy it.""  And it was a huge success and it became my
biggest position and I always worried somebody'd come out with a competitive
product, and about a year-and-a-half they were on the market another large
company called Kaiser-Roth came out with a product called No Nonsense.
They put it right next to L'eggs in the supermarket, right next to L'eggs in
the drugstore.  I said, ""Wow, I gotta figure this one out.""  So I remember
buying -- I bought 48 different pairs at the supermarket, colors, shapes, and
sizes.  They must have wondered what kind of house I had at home when I got to
the register.  They just let me buy it.  So I brought it into the office.  I
gave it to everybody.  I said, ""Try this out and come back and see what's the
story with No Nonsense.""  And people came back to me in a couple weeks and
said, ""It's not as good.""  That's what fundamental research is.  So I held onto
Hanes and it was a huge stock and it was bought out by Consolidated Foods,
which is now called Sara Lee, and it's been a great division of that company.
It might have been a thirty bagger instead of a ten bagger, if it hadn't been
bought out.",0
803,"The beginning of the bull market in 1982 and the environment.  Were
you surprised?","1982 was a very scary period for this country.  We've had nine
recessions since World War II.  This was the worst. 14 percent inflation.  We
had a 20 percent prime rate, 15 percent long governments.  It was ugly.  And
the economy was really much in a free-fall and people were really worried, ""Is
this it?  Has the American economy had it?  Are we going to be able to control
inflation?""  I mean there was a lot of very uncertain times.  You had to say to
yourself, ""I believe it in.  I believe in stocks.  I believe in companies.  I
believe they can control this.  And this is an anomaly.  Double-digit inflation
is rare thing. Doesn't happen very often. And, in fact,  one of my shareholders
wrote me and said, ""Do you realize that over half the companies in your
portfolio are losing money right now?""  I looked up, he was right, or she was
right.  But I was ready.  I mean I said, ""These companies are going to do well
once the economy comes back.  We've got out of every other recession.  I don't
see why we won't come out of this one.""  And it came out and once we came back,
the market went north.",0
804,Nobody told you it was coming.,"It's lovely to know when there's recession.  I don't remember anybody
predicting 1982 we're going to have 14 percent inflation, 12 percent
unemployment, a 20 percent prime rate, you know, the worst recession since the
Depression.  I don't remember any of that being predicted.  It just happened.
It was there.  It was ugly.  And I don't remember anybody telling me about it.
So I don't worry about any of that stuff.  I've always said if you spend 13
minutes a year on economics, you've wasted 10 minutes.",0
805,So what should people think about?,"Well, they should think about what's happening.  I'm talking about
economics as forecasting the future.  If you own auto stocks you ought to be
very interested in used car prices.  If you own aluminum companies you ought to
be interested in what's happened to inventories of aluminum.  If your stock are
hotels, you ought to be interested in how many people are building hotels.
These are facts.  People talk about what's going to happen in the future, that
the average recession last .2 years or who knows?  There's no reason why we
can't have an average economic expansion that lasts longer.  I mean I deal in
facts, not forecasting the future.  That's crystal ball stuff.  That doesn't
work.  Futile.",0
806,"Talk about going from one to five to ten billion and whether people
thought it was getting too big.","Sure.  I certainly remember when Magellan passed the billion.  I
remember it was sometime in 1983 and then remember I think in '84, I don't
remember exactly when it became the largest fund in the country, and people
said, ""Magellan's too big at a billion to get in, to get out.  It's hopeless.
Leave.""  And then when it became a largest fund, ""It's obviously too big now.""
And then it got to five billion, they said, ""Forget it.""  When it got to ten
billion, they said, ""Forget it.""  And I'd always say, ""If I could beat the
market by three or four percent a  year I'm really doing a service to the
public.""  And then after I left, they said, ""The fund's too big.  Forget it.""
And, ah, Magellan's done extremely well in the six years since I left it.  It's
beaten the market.  It's beaten 80 percent of all funds.  So I mean I hope they
keep warning people to stay away from it.  It's been a terrific thing for it.",0
807,Can the little guy play with the big guy in the stock market?,"There's always been this position that the small investor has no chance
against the big institutions.  And I always wonder whether that's the person
under four-foot-eight.  I mean they always said the small investor doesn't have
a chance.  And there's two issues there.  First of all, I think that he or she
can do it, but, number two, the question is, people do it anyway.  They invest
anyway.  And if they so believe this theory that the small investor has no
chance, they invest in a different format.  They said, ""This is a casino.  I'll
buy stock this month.  I'll sell it a month later,"" same kind of performance
that they do everywhere.  When they look at a house, they're very careful.
They look at the school system.  They look at the street.  They look at the
plumbing.  When they buy a refrigerator, they do homework.  If they're so
convinced that the small investor has no chance, the stock market's a big game
and they act accordingly, they hear a stock and they buy it before sunset,
they're going to get the kind of results that prove the small investor can do
poorly.  Now if you buy a -- you make a mistake on a car, you make a mistake on
a house, you don't blame the professional investors.  But now if you do stupid
research, you buy some company that has no sales, no earnings, a terrible
financial position and it goes down, you say, ""Well, it because of the
programmed trading of those professionals,"" that's because you didn't do your
homework.  So I -- I've tried to convince people they can do a job, they can do
very well, but they have to do certain things.",0
808,Wouldn't one of those things be letting you do it for them?,"Well, the small investor can do three things.  They can avoid the market
entirely.  They can just say, ah, ""I can't stand it.  It's too volatile for me.
I'll just put my money in money market funds or put my money in the bank.""
That's one choice.  The other choice is they can invest directly in the stock
market by buying stocks individually, or they can buy mutual funds and invest
in stock.  I think they can do  the course of investing in mutual funds and
every now and then, they find some stocks, they have a chance the make a big
hit.  I think the average person could know three or four or five companies
very well.  They could lecture on those three or four or five companies, and if
one or two of 'em becomes attractive, they buy 'em.  They just can't wake up in
the morning and say, ""Now's the time to buy this.  Now's the time to buy IBM.
Now's the time to by GE.  Now's the time to buy Dow Chemical.  Now's the time
to buy some biotechnology company,"" if they don't know something about it.  You
have to know the story.  And people have lots of edges and they throw them
away.",0
809,Talk about market timing.,"The market itself is very volatile.  We've had 95 years completed this
century.  We're in the middle of 1996 and we're close to a 10 percent decline.
In the 95 years so far, we've had 53 declines in the market of 10 percent or
more.  Not 53 down years.  The market might have been up 26 finished the year
up four, and had a 10 percent correction.  So we've had 53 declines in 95
years.  That's once every two years.  Of the 53, 15 of the 53 have been 25
percent or more.  That's a bear market.  So 15 in 95 years, about once every
six years you're going to have a big decline.  Now no one seems to know when
there are gonna happen.  At least if they know about 'em, they're not telling
anybody about 'em.  I don't remember anybody predicting the market right more
than once, and they predict a lot.  So they're gonna happen.  If you're in the
market, you have to know there's going to be declines.  And they're going to
cap and every couple of years you're going to get a 10 percent correction.
That's a euphemism for losing a lot of money rapidly.  That's what a
""correction"" is called.  And a bear market is 20-25-30 percent decline.
They're gonna happen.  When they're gonna start, no one knows.  If you're not
ready for that, you shouldn't be in the stock market.  I mean stomach is the
key organ here.  It's not the brain.  Do you have the stomach for these kind of
declines?  And what's your timing like?  Is your horizon one year?  Is your
horizon ten years or 20 years?  If you've been lucky enough to save up lots of
money and you're about to send one kid to college and your child's starting a
year from now, you decide to invest in stocks directly or with a mutual fund
with a one-year horizon or a two-year horizon, that's silly.  That's just like
betting on red or black at the casino.  What the market's going to do in one or
two years, you don't know.  Time is on your side in the stock market.  It's on
your side.  And when stocks go down, if you've got the money, you don't worry
about it and you're putting more in, you shouldn't worry about it.  You should
worry what are stocks going to be 10 years from now, 20 years from now, 30
years from now.  I'm very confident.",0
810,"If you had invested in '66, it would have taken 15 years to make the
money back.","Well, from '66 to 1982, the market basically was flat.  But you still
had dividends in stocks.  You still had a positive return.  You made a few
percent a year.  That was the worst period other than the 1920s, in this
century.  So companies still pay dividends, even though if their stock goes
sideways for ten years, they continue to pay you dividends, they continue to
raise their dividends.  So you have to say the yourself, ""What are corporate
profits going to do?""  Historically, corporate profits have grown about eight
percent a year.  Eight percent a year.  They double every nine years.  They
quadruple every 18.  They go up six-fold every 25 years.  So guess what?  In
the last 25 years corporate profits have gone up a little over six-fold, the
stock market's gone up a little bit over six-fold, and you've had a two or
three percent dividend yield, you've made about 11 percent a year.  There's an
incredible correlation over time.",0
811,"You believe that the majority of small investors had lost money and
that's why they're in mutual funds?","I wrote three books and I had great help with doing  it with John
Rothschild, is I really want to help the average person.  My wife and I have
given all the profits from those books to charity.  I want to help people do a
better job investing, understand the market because what amazes me is we've had
this phenomenal market.  You start 1982, August of '82, the market's 777.  In
May of 1996, it's at 5700.  I'm that's up almost seven-fold.  That's an
incredible advance.  Now how come there's not a lot more people buyin' stocks?
How come the number of registered shareholders hasn't gone up dramatically?
When antiques were hot, lots of who were doin' antiques.  When rugs were hot,
they were doin' rugs.  When baseball cards were in, thousands of people were
into baseball cards, tens of thousands.  And people were fixin' up old cars.
The only thing I can conclude from the fact there hasn't been a great jump in
the amount of people directly investing in the stock market has been in this
best bull market of all time, August of '82 to 19-- May of '96, best stock
market ever, people must have done a mediocre job or they would be doing more
of it themselves and they'd be telling their friends about it and their
friends'd be doing it.  So their method must be flawed.",0
812,What does that say to you about their frame of mind?,"Well, for some reason, the public looks at stocks differently
than they look at everything else.  When they buy a refrigerator, they do
research.  When they buy a microwave oven, they do research.  They'll get
<u>Consumer Reports</u>.  They'll ask a customer ""What's your favorite kind of
oven?  What kind of car would you buy?""  Then they'll -- they'll put $10,000 in
some zany stock that they don't even know what it does that they heard on a bus
on the way to work and wonder why they lose money, and they do it before
sunset.  Well, you've got plenty of time.  You could have bought Wal-Mart ten
years after it went public -- Wal-Mart went public in 1970.  You could have
bought it ten years later and made 30 times your money.  You could have said,
""I'm very cautious.  I'm very careful.  I'm gonna wait.  I want to make sure
this company -- they're just in Arkansas and I want to watch 'em go to other
states.""  So you watch, five years later the stock's up about four-fold.  You
say, ""I'm still not sure of this company.  They have a great balance sheet,
great record.""  I'm going to wait another -- wait another five years, it goes
up another four-fold.  It's now up twenty-fold.  You still haven't invested.
You say, ""Now I think it's time to invest in Wal-Mart.""  You still could have
made 30 times your money because ten years after Wal-Mart went public they were
only in 15 percent of the United States.  They hadn't saturated that 15 percent
and they were very low cost.  They were in small towns.  You could say to
yourself, ""Why can't they go to 17?  Why can't they go to 19?  Why can't they
go to 21?  I'll get on the computer.  Why can't they go to 28?""  And that's all
they did.  They just replicated their formula.  That doesn't take a lot of
courage.  That's homework.",0
813,The high and the low analysis.,"People spend all this time trying to figure out ""What time of the
year should I make an investment?  When should I invest?""  And it's such a
waste of time.  It's so futile. I did a great study, it's an amazing exercise.
In the 30 years, 1965 to 1995, if you had invested a thousand dollars, you had
incredible good luck, you invested a the low of the year, you picked the low
day of the year, you put your thousand dollars in, your return would have been
11.7 compounded.  Now some poor unlucky soul, the Jackie Gleason of the world,
put in the high of the year.  He or she picked the high of the year, put their
thousand dollars in at the peak every single time, miserable record, 30 years
in a row, picked the high of the year.  Their return was 10.6  That's the only
difference between the high of the year and the low of the year.  Some other
person put in the first day of the year, their return was 11.0.  I mean the
odds of that are very little, but people spend an unbelievable amount of mental
energy trying to pick what the market's going to do, what time of the year to
buy it.  It's just not worth it.",0
814,So they just buy and hold?,"They should buy, hold, and when the market goes down, add to it.  Every
time the market goes down 10 percent, you add to it, you'd be much -- you would
have better return than the average of 11 percent, if you believe in it, if
it's money you're not worried about.  As the market starts going down, you say,
""Oh, it'll be fine.  It'll be predictable.""  When it starts going down and
people get laid off, a friend of yours,  loses their job or a company has
10,000 employees and they lay off two.  The other 998,000 people start to worry
or somebody says their house price just went down, these are little thoughts
that start to creep to the front of your brain.  And they're the back of your
brain.  And human nature hasn't changed much in 5,000 years.  There's this
thing of greed versus fear.  The market's going up, you're not worried.  All of
a sudden it starts going down and you start saying, ""I remember my uncle told
me, you know, somebody lost it all in the Depression.  People were jumping out
of windows.  They were selling pencils and apples.""  It must have been a great
decade to buy a pencil or an apple, but they were always -- there must have
been everybody selling pencils.  That start to -- we laugh about it.  People
start to think about these things with the market going down.  These ugly
thoughts start coming into the picture.  Gotta get 'em out.  You have to wipe
those out and you -- you either believe in it or you don't.",0
815,"The fact of the matter is, in the America that we live in, there are
a lot of people who feel they have no choice, that they have to be in the
market.  What do those people do?","Well, if people don't have the stomach, they really don't have it, the
volatility's too much for them with the stock market, they can avoid it.  They
could buy money market funds and they'd get a little bit better than inflation.
They will not get, in my opinion, the same return the next 20 years, the next
30 years they would get by buying stocks.  That doesn't sound like much, but
over the long period of time Treasury Bills and money markets have yielded a
little bit higher than inflation, bonds have yielded five or six percent, and
stocks have yielded a total of 11.  The differences are massive over 30 years,
but that's not a bad return to get a positive return.  If you're worried, it's
better than losing money.",0
816,How do those people educate their kids and retire?,"They have to save more.  The public's not saving enough.  Our whole
system's all backwards.  If you borrow money to spend, add addition to your
house, it's tax deductible, you save money, they tax you on it.  I mean the
public has figured out very well there's no inducement to save.  Our system is
very confusing.  We have the highest capital gains rate in the  history of this
country right now.  The capital gains rates in Japan is zero.  They have a 20
percent savings rate in Japan.  We have to have a higher savings rate.  No
one's encouraging savings.  And it's the one thing I remember from college is
savings equals investment.  For every savings of a dollar, money goes into
capital investment, that yields more productivity, yields more jobs, yields
better standard of living.  We are not saving enough money.  That's the most
single important thing people have to do, they have to save some more.",0
817,"With so many people investing in mutual funds, let's consider two
issues.  Short-term profit....long-term stability?","Well, if corporate management's job is to make the company deal well and
make a good job for employees, provide a good service, they know if they do
something very slick, very fast and it works well for three months, their
competitors will knock 'em off.  They have to come out with a better product.
They have to come out with better services.  So I think the real issue is they
have to think long-term and they're doing that.  They have to say, ""We have to
stay competitive and we have to think about ways -- we just introduced a me-too
product.  That's not enough.  It has to be a better product.""  And I think
that's been the difference.  ""Can we lower our costs?""  You see that with the
telephone companies.  You see it with electric utilities.  You see it with
broadcasting.  You see it with gas companies, industries that never even
thought of this -- publishing, just throughout all of the America in the
retailing industry, better ways of delivering products.  And it's a serious
effort and it's a long-term effort.  And they're trying to spend more and more
time to say, ""How can we do a better job?  We just can't raise prices.  That
game's over.""",0
818,"So companies get a bad rap for this short-term, long-term
business?","Well, there is a group of people that buy companies, sell this division,
sell that division, sell that off and divide it up and that's a very small
minority.  It doesn't happen very often.  And they used to be able to use junk
bonds.  That day's over.  They used to get a lot of money from the banking
system to do an LBO.  That day's over.  So now a corporate buyer's a legitimate
buyer.  It's a major company buys another company.  It's not somebody who puts
a thousand dollars down and borrow 23 billion and then tries to sell parts off.
So I think corporate managements are doing a very good job of saving companies.
But a lot of times it's a tough decision.  They don't like lettin' people go.
No one enjoys that.  The question is, if we can slim down and get more
efficient, it'd be better off for 90 percent of the employees than ""If we don't
do it, we could become another Eastern Air Lines, another Pan Am and everybody
loses their job.""",0
819,"A lot of people worry that the mutual fund pressure has caused a lot
of pain in this country ...","Well, I think it was the recession of '81 and '82 that was the wake-up
call.  It  wasn't the stock market.  It wasn't mutual funds managers.  It's
competition.  It's competitor in the apparel industry.  It's competition in the
textile industry.  It's competitor in the housing industry.  It's competitor in
the broadcast industry independent of mutual fund managers.  Now you look at
AT&amp;T, about 11 years ago they broke up AT&amp;T, had one million employees.
One out of every hundred Americans was working for the telephone company.  If
you put together AT&amp;T and all the Baby Bells today, you'd have about 700--
less than 700,000 workers and they're doing double the amount of telephone
calls, twenty times the faxes, a hundred times the data communications, a
thousand times the cellular with 30 percent less employees.  Now is that good
for America or bad for America?  Would we be better off if they had two million
employees?  I think we're just better off that they have less employees and
they're doing a better job.",0
820,Why?,"That's -- competition, because we have the lowest cost communication
system in the world.  It's the single most important thing.  It's not the
highway system.  Communications is the single most important and we're the
lowest cost.  That helps us compete with the rest of the world.",0
821,"Talk companies that have gone public since the bull market started
and the flow of capital ...","I get asked a lot by people, you know, ""Where's this money that's going
into mutual funds of my money?  Other people's money.  Where is this going to
wind up?""  One wonderful thing that happened, the last three years over a
hundred-billion dollars has gone into initial public offerings.  These are new
companies coming public.  We've had over 2,500 companies come public.  That's
over two a business day.  These companies now have more money for equipment,
more money for research.  They have a better balance sheet.  They can borrow
more.  They are going to hire more people and more jobs.  These are going to be
the companies like the next Staples, the next Federal Express, the next
Compaq.  That's what made America grow.",0
822,So my money winds up in Amgen?,"The money the public puts into mutual funds, a large percentage of that
is wound up going into finance new issues.  From '65 to 1995 in America we
added 54 million jobs.  The European Union, the old Common Market, has 100
million more people.  In those 30 years, they added 10 million jobs.  They
added 10 million jobs in 30 years.  We added 54 million jobs.  There's 10
percent unemployment in Europe, 20 million people out of work.  We are very
lucky we've had these companies come public.  That's what made this country
hold together.  Business has done a terrific job.  We ought to be very happy.
I don't think 2,500 companies have come public in Europe since Charlemagne, and
I think he became King of the Francs in 788.  This is a wonderful thing we have
in this country, this initial public offerings, putting money into small and
medium-sized companies and let them grow.",0
823,"Do you think Vinik got a bad rap, too much emphasis put on
short-term record?","Jeff Vinik ran Magellan Fund for a little over four years.  It beat the
market.  It beat 80 percent of all other funds.  So if you went somewhere else,
you would have been in the 80 percent that lost out to Magellan.  Now the last
nine months Magellan didn't have a great record, but when you have a basketball
game and at the end of the game its 105 to 85, they don't say to the team, ""
the third quarter you lost by 32 to 22.  What happened to the third quarter?""
I mean I think a four years is a reasonable period of time to look over a
record.  I think Jeff Vinik did a very good job the time he ran Magellan.",0
824,Too much scrutiny is unfair at this point?,"Well, I can't say whether there's too much scrutiny or not enough
scrutiny.  I think there's a lot of watching of the largest fund in the
country.  The question is, can it continue to beat the market like it's done
under Morris Smith, under Jeff Vinik, and under Bob Stansky.  And it's
still a very small percent of the market.  I mean 50 billion is a very large
number, but when you think the New York Stock Exchange is five-and-a-half
trillion.  If you look at the hundred largest stocks over-the-counter, there's
another trillion.  You look at the 200 largest stocks overseas is several
trillion, I mean it's not a very small -- it's a very small percentage of the
available market.  All you have to do really is find the best  hundred stocks
in the S&amp;P 500 and find another few hundred outside the S&amp;P 500 to beat
the market.",0
825,That's all?,That's all you do.,0
826,What was Magellan's size when you left?,"When I left Magellan Fund, it was 14 billion.",0
827,And where is it today?,Today over 50 billion.,0
828,What has caused that incredible influx of money?,"Well, part of it, the market was 2700 when I left.  You know, and
before today the market was 5500.  So,  the market doubled, plus dividends has
brought a lot of it, and people already were there.  So they kept adding.  So
every year people kept adding money and as it's gone up, it was up over 35
percent in 1995, I mean those compound to give you very big numbers.  So it's
some people adding do it and the fund doing very well.  It went up when Morris
Smith ran it.  So it's gone up a lot in six years.",0
829,"I think this is going to be a rare privilege for everybody. I've known Li Lu now for more than 20 years, and not only is he a great investor, but he's a great conversationalist. So why don't we just start out by talking about how your investment philosophy has changed? Because value investing is, after all, always an evolving field since you began the field, literally, I think I would say, 25 years ago, 20 years ago?",More like 28 now. Time really flies.,0
830,So how has it evolved? So how have you been influenced by people like Charlie Munger?,"Well, so before I started, I just want to first of all, thank you and all the organizers of this great conferences. Look at the way the speaker are just really unbelievable. So the quality of the student has dramatically improved since I was a student there. So thank you all for that wonderful work of putting together these great conferences. And it just really gives me such a pleasure to be on the same panel as my professor, Bruce Greenwald. In fact, I got into this field really because of Professor Greenwald's class. I think, you know, basically you got Buffett to come to speak to the students roughly 28 years ago. And it was really out of that first lecture that we got into this field. So thank you so much. And of course, later, as a business school student, I took all of the courses that Professor Greenwald offered and learned a great deal and made a lot of money, too. So thank you.
So the philosophy is relatively simple. The practice is really hard. So I wouldn't say the philosophy really evolved all that much for me. Before I got really exposed to value investing through Buffet's lecture at Bruce Greenwald's class, I think my whole approach to life was pretty much a set along similar lines. And so there was not much of a jump for me. The idea of buying something at a discount of something that is really worth more is simply intelligent. So (I would assume) that all intelligent investing involves some kind of value investing. And now the difference is, is that your focus on value evolves over time and two different individuals they tend to focus on different areas of that.
For me, when I first started as a value investor, this is now 27, 28 years ago when I bought my first stock. I didn't really know much about business. I was born and raised in China during the Cultural Revolution. There was not much of a private business or market economy back then, so I had to learn everything new. So at the beginning, obviously look for value primarily on the balance sheet in the classic style of Benjamin Graham, looking for a cigarette-butt, looking for the last puff basically. Looking for a statistically cheap businesses and ignore what the business really is. And that served me well.
Then over time, I evolved into understanding smaller businesses. Because I was just intensively curious about how business run. So much so, actually I evolved to help funding or co-created a dozen or so early-stage startup companies. And that experience has taught me a lot about how business is run, what constitutes bad or mediocre businesses. And so over time I evolved into looking for really good businesses, small maybe, but really good businesses. And then that leads me to look for good businesses in Asia, and eventually for businesses with an enduring competitive advantage with a long growth trajectory ahead of it. And so the places where we're looking for value evolves over time, but the basic philosophy I have pretty much remained the same. But it's just our core competence expanded over time.
Now, I have been very fortunate to be influenced at the very beginning by the investment giant Buffett and Munger and later on I was really, really lucky. It was just a stroke of luck that you can't even make up in fiction, that I struck a good connection with Charlie Munger and he became an investor in 2003, 2004. And we've been partners since then basically. He has been a mentor, an investor, a business partner and a great friend all these years. And for many, many years we have dinner every Tuesday night. So that's my version of Tuesday night with Charlie, every week. That lasted for years until just around a pandemic. And we talk a lot more. So obviously, I had a great deal of influence by him. But I have to say that the greatest influence from Charlie was really beyond just investment.
It was more of a role model in the way he conducted himself in real life. Now I think for every profession, for everybody, it is wonderful to have role models in life. And often the role model is among the eminent dead because it's safer. So it's pretty risky to pick a role model that's still alive. And it is always a risk of disappointing. But in my case, I got really, really lucky in the sense that my role model never failed and instead continued to inspire me, right into his 97th year, basically. And so mostly it's really based on his attitude towards life and his ability to keep equanimity in a sense, in the face of ups and downs, successes or setbacks. And I've witnessed quite a bit of them over the 17 years or so we've been working closely to maintain that rational composure, commonsensical approach to all problems in investment or life. That is extraordinarily hard, and it is a bit against our natural tendencies. And I've really watched up close and personal, how Charlie has conducted himself. And it is in that regard that he's probably the most influential person in my life. And I have been very, very lucky in that regard.",0
831,"Ok, so, in this concentration, in sort of now investing in great businesses, can you be specific about what kind of business you look for? What are the characteristics of a great business in particular, what detailed characteristics you look for and how you put a value on those businesses?","Yeah, well, great businesses are the ones who really have above average returns on invested capital. But that kind of a business traditionally attract imitators, competitors, everybody wants to have above average returns on reinvested capital. And so truly good businesses are the ones who can fend off competitors, who can really have an enduring competitive advantage and have that higher than average return on invested capital and hopefully also have a long run-rate of continuous growth. Those are the businesses we're looking for. And they could really come in all industries, in all shapes and forms. But they're rare. They're really, really rare to have a business that generates above average returns over a long time on a compounded fashion is, again is really against the natural order of things. It’s really only a small slice of all businesses (that) belong to that category.
So if you're really lucky enough to really find one of those long-term compounders, all you have to do is really to own them for the longest period of time. Now, it helps when you really buy them at the time when they happen to be traded at a discount to their intrinsic value so that if you were wrong about them, you won't lose money, and if you're right, you have more returns over time. But over the longest period of time, if you do own them through the ups and downs, your return roughly approximates basically the actual business return to actual capital invested in the business itself over the long term. The two tend to really converge pretty closely.
And so understanding and studying the nature of that business, the dynamic of the competition is of really the most important thing as the investor, and as a student of the business. And as I said, there isn't really a set of things that really made them that way. Every business really build their fortress slightly different, and you just have to really actually be honest with yourself and study them from every possible angle until you're really convinced that they are actually currently enjoying truly enduring (competitive advantages), and they truly have a long runway ahead of them. And if they prove to be exactly as you predicted over the years, we really want to stay on them through the up and down, thick and thin, not to be really dissuaded easily.",0
832,"Ok, can I actually talk a little bit about those businesses, I mean, in limiting competition and I think Charlie Munger is the master of this, we're really interested in moat's. That is the barriers to entry into the business because it's keeping people out. That's going to limit competition. If you think about a moat, there are probably only two elements to that moat. So think of it from the point of view of a company trying to get into the business.
One is economies of scale. How big do you have to get? How big a market share do you have to capture in order to be viable as a competitor? So in automobiles, in the global automobile market, it's really large. And if you have got 1-2% share, you're going to be fine. In other markets, like, for example, local distribution of caffeinated soft drinks, you've got to get to 20-25% of the market to support the infrastructure that you need to compete. So the first thing is economies of scale.
The second thing I think and again, I'm sort of thinking about Charlie Munger here, is how hard is it to get that market share? Which is all about customer captivity in a contested environment where unique technology will help you with that and so on. So suppose you've got to get to 25% share, we know for caffeinated soft drinks that two tenths of a percent share changes hands every year in a contested market. So to get to 25% you're talking about a 125-year moat.
Do you do a calculation like that for the companies you're looking at? Do you look at those two elements explicitly?","Well, that and more.",0
833,Ok. So what's the more'?,"Scale is important in there, actually, there is a scale economies in those businesses, not everything actually has a scale. Sometimes that scale becomes a counterpoint, they could actually be more difficult to really manage. But in a scale economy, scale does really become a competitive advantage. But the dynamic will change after a certain scale, you mentioned automobiles, that's an interesting example, you know what happens at different phases of the industry. The consumer side is also important in a sense that if you have quite a bit of consumer addiction to certain products and brand loyalty, obviously that is important and they're good for a long time until they're not good. Things do change. New product categories would come along, and brands get tired and old, and not refreshed. The new generations really don't like to have the same taste as their parents and grandparents. So that's really the most interesting aspect of businesses is, (the) only constant is the constant change. All great business changes over time. And (there's) absolutely no business that can really maintain that competitive edge for forever. But some of the businesses can really keep it for a very, very long time. And of course, when it changes it's really upon the management team to be able to really reallocate capital towards those businesses, (that are) actually now enjoying a robust competitive advantage.
Take example with Berkshire. It started out as a lousy business, losing business of textile in New England. And Warren and Charlie's skill is that they took the last bit of the cash flow and skillfully invested in some other businesses, really on the right side of the trajectory. But over time, some of those businesses began to lose its competitive advantage and then they took that capital and allocated to the ones that&#8230;so obviously the management capability of allocating capital also plays a very important role. And, of course, that the culture of a company in the industry that's rapidly changing so that you are always a few steps ahead of your competitors, which allows you to always (inaudible) on the edge, that also becomes enduring competitive advantage if that culture endures. So in every specific businesses, what really make them successful are very, very different and they change over time. And so that is the most fascinating aspect of the competitive dynamics and those are the most fascinating aspect of being an investor as well.",0
834,"As of today, how do you view this differently, would you say from most other investors? Are there things that you look at specifically? Are there ways that you approach companies?
Now, I'll tell you the thing that when I started investing with you, and I'm honored to say that I made a lot of money doing it, that appealed to me was what you mentioned in your introduction, which is small&#8230;markets are necessarily markets where you have to get a big share because one firm can dominate. And that's not something that most investors look at. So in what other ways do you do things differently from most other value investors and investors?","Well, you're right. You invested with me or you begin to invest in me. Thank God you're still with me. So thank you for your continued trust and confidence. No, back then we were looking for smaller businesses because those are the businesses I feel I can understand them. And as we evolve, we began to look for big businesses that we can also understand. That bigger business does come with a whole set of advantages, that if they are right in a sense, they also come in with a whole bunch of problems. And so we're not really looking at just big or medium or small. Size is one consideration, but it's not the most important, certainly not a determining factor is when we're looking for businesses. There are big businesses that because of a certain dynamic, are still growing at a robust pace that are becoming even more entrenched as they become bigger. And they still have long runs of growth. So that just exist. You know, the most recent phenomenon of the technology platform, because of the network effect, some of the business are fitting that characteristics. Now, they don't necessarily always grow forever, but they have been growing for a long, long time and likely to continue for some time. And so just the size itself is certainly not the most determining factor.",0
835,But then what other dimensions do you do things differently today than other investors who are less successful?,"If they go down 50% to 60% we buy more, so that really gives you a measure of our definition of when we understand them.",0
836,"Ok, so what about the market today? I mean, it seems highly valued. I mean, if you look at fixed income, it seems unprecedented. That said, does the market today remind you of any historical periods you lived through in good ways or bad? And would you have advice for anybody I'm having now?","Well, we usually don't study too much about the market except when they are really extreme. And this happens to be one of the more extreme periods of time. It is truly, in many ways, somewhere in unchartered territory. The amount of liquidity that's been printed, the level of interest rates, and also the slow pace of growth. All of those are quite really remarkable in this period of time. So how do you really deal with them. We don't necessarily think that history would repeat. And so every time is slightly different. Instead of guessing the patterns of history and whether they would repeat, we focus on selecting companies that can really live through the thick and thin, whatever the environment, business will continue. Somebody will do well. So we just want to really be invested in those companies who are capable of dealing with those extraordinary set of uncertainties. (Inaudible)",0
837,And how much is management a part of that. And how do you look for managements that have that capability?,"Well, in a lot of the companies, the management will make a big difference. The culture of the management will make a big difference. But in a small set of experiences, management really matters almost nothing. The strength of the business itself really has a dynamic of its own that really almost anybody can run it and run it well, relatively. Now, those businesses are really rare, not that many. You can probably put them in one hand or two hands. And so&#8230;again, I come back to the situation, each time is different. You have to really look for each specific company in specific ways and ask all kinds of probing questions and study them over a long period of time in order to really honestly say that you actually understand them. Understand them enough that you could predict the outcome in 10 years, even given all the up and downs in the macro environment.",0
838,"So you've lived through in your 23 years running Himalaya, a number of major financial crises, the Asia crisis in '97, the tech bust in 2000, the financial crisis in 2008 and actually last year, the covid-19 situation. Are there specific things you learn about managements or companies that you look for in those crises?","Yeah, well, so as you said, in my 24 years of managing Himalaya Capital, we have gone through several of those big crises. Each time when that happens, it was billed as once in a century crisis. It probably was, except it happens on the time frame of every 5 to 10 years. So a financial market boom and bust has been a constant phenomenon since the beginning of the financial market several hundred years ago. And it was driven by human nature, as long human nature remains that way, it will never change. It will always be with us. As a product of evolution, we humans are basically run not necessarily in a very rational way. Now we're very good at rationalization, but we're really not very good at being rational&#8230;In a sense, we're governed by some set of hard wired, hard coded instincts. And looking for a zero sum and we're looking for fast money, and they're really totally scared when things goes against you. So that's basic sense of greed and fear, it will always drive the financial market up and down. Particularly when it comes to money, humans are very funny. They tend to evoke a primal part of human nature. And so particularly as it relates to financial markets, a security market, money, that that human tendency of the extreme instincts become more amplified and more extreme. And that's why the financial market from the very beginning has always been characterized by boom and bust and will remain so. And how do you deal with such an environment that will be constant? One way to deal with that is to anticipate that it's always on the corner at all times. And that's basically our attitude, that financial crisis will happen all the time. People will always be driven by fear, by euphoria, by this extreme kind of ups and downs. And so we're looking for businesses that are capable of living through that and even businesses that could really thrive in that environment. In a sense, have a certain characteristic of antifragile and so that up and down becomes somewhat friendly for us. In the sense that when our favorite company is on sale discounted by 50, 60, 70 percent, if we have money, will buy more of it. If we don't have the money, it is the hallmark of a good investor, you can sit through watching your portfolio down by 50% and not being affected at all.
On the other hand, the other side of the coin is that you're equally unaffected when everybody around you are making fast money, fast and furious, a lot of them. Now you're really seemingly totally left behind. And that's really part of the temperament that most people don't have. And that's why not everybody can succeed in this game of investment. And so to succeed in this game requires a certain temperament and a certain understanding of human nature. Also a certain commonsensical approach. Knowing that your investment return eventually will mirror the actual business return by actual business. You know, in real life, real businesses don't really change by day, by hour, by week, by months. It took years for them to either go up or down. And so you should expect your investment result that come in slowly, gradually over a long period of time. So the short-term phenomena should not really impact you as much, either on the up or on the down. So if you have that basic temperament and basic approaches, what you're going to find is that most euphoria, as well as the crash, actually can serve you well. And this is really going back to Ben Graham's basic concept of Mr. Market that is there to serve you, not instruct you. Except in the real game of investment, those phenomena, those on the up and down tend to be quite extreme and testing. And so the other thing that will be very testing is that we really do need to understand the business itself. And if you really try to pretend you understand and you are really driven by something else other than deep understanding, you'll be tested. And so that's the salient nature of the of the financial market. I sometimes almost feel that they exist to really catch human weakness. That if you really don't understand something that you pretend to, you will be busted at some point. But if you truly understand, you will be able to add when the security will be down 50, 60, 70%.",0
839,"Can I actually talk a little bit about a specific example there and maybe get you to talk about an example? Because one of the things that you talked about was the stability of these companies and their managements in the face of a crisis. So a crisis tells you a lot. And the one company that obviously recently has done extremely well and you could see it is John Deere.
So if you looked at John Deere in 2000, demand fell by 5% and their profit margins fell to zero. If you look at what happens to them in '13, '14, demand falls 35% and their profit margin stays at roughly half of what it was before, which is higher than it had been historically. So clearly, that's a company that's changed and in the face of sort of catastrophic external conditions, has gone from doing quite badly to doing much better. Do you have examples of that from the companies you've invested in, where you've seen them perform through a crisis?","I do in my 27, 28 years of investment, that's the kind of things you'll collect. But normally we don't talk about specific companies.",0
840,But could you share maybe a historical experience of that so that the students in the audience might have a sense of what to look for in looking for this stability?,"Well, Bruce, we've tried this multiple times in your class. I'm not going to change.",0
841,"I know, it's very familiar to me.","And there is a simple logic, a reason why we don't do that. Once you achieve a certain notoriety in a certain field that people tend to really copy that. And that's not the kind of behavior we want to encourage. Instead of giving people fish, it is much better to really teach people how to fish.",0
842,"Ok, so let me do one last question. Do you prefer to be a generalist or a specialist investor and would one work better in the Chinese market than another?","Well, in a sense, you always want to be a generalist in terms of a student of businesses that you're interested&#8230;To be good at this game, you have to have the innate intensive curiosity about a business, all kinds of businesses. It doesn't mean you're going to really, really get to the bottom of it. Oftentimes you don't if you're honest with yourself. But by the time you really get into the companies you really decided to invest, you really better become a true specialist. And to the point of really know, hopefully better than anybody in the world you can find, including the top management team. And the top management team, because they manage the company, they tend to be deeply personally vested in their own biases and may not be able to look at the business as objectively, rationally as you do. And so that's really the test.
So you want to be a true specialist in the company you chose to really invest. You want to be a generalist always of business in general, so that your core competence, your circle of competence is constantly evolving and enlarging over time. If I still really know what I knew when I started my first took your class or when you first invested with me, we would not have&#8230;anywhere near the results that we both enjoyed, so luckily we continue to expand and we continue to learn. But on the other hand, it is fascinating to see that how business evolved over the last few decades will continue to evolve in the next few decades. And that really makes me feel that boy I am lucky to choose this field that I get paid to really satisfy my curiosity and to learn all those great people and great enterprises serving society. So I feel happy every day doing what I do.",0
843,"Ok, so let's talk about the evolution of markets and in particular at a 2010 panel at Columbia Business School, you mentioned that Asia's role in the global financial system was becoming increasingly important. Looking back, how has Asia's role evolved in the last 10 years, and what about China's role going forward in both the world's business economy and in the financial?","(Inaudible) turned out exactly as we predicted, Asia indeed became a lot more important, in particularly China in it, has becomes even more important. As I look at in the next few decades, I would say that the Chinese market, and Asia in general, will become even more important. The set of dynamics that are already set in place, will continue to play out in a robust way, so the Chinese security market in general and Asia economy, that will become increasingly a very, very important, evermore important component of the global market.",0
844,"Well, all right, so let me give you some data that I don't think is widely appreciated. I mean, the Chinese numbers are obviously very difficult to interpret, at least the official numbers. And whenever you see that from a company, the data you really want to look at is the data where there's a reliable counterparty, and the trade data is where there's reliable counterparty, because every Chinese export has to be an import from another country and every Chinese import has to be an export from another country.
Over the last 8 to 10 years, China trade has grown by only about 2.5% per year. That's less than 1% faster than US trade. What does that say about Chinese growth? I mean, that's clearly much slower than the trade growth prior to 2010, 2011, and it's fluctuated obviously, but if anything, it's been slowing down. What does that say about China's future?","It tells you about the characteristics of the Chinese economy has changed fundamentally. You know, up until 10 years ago, what really propels the Chinese growth&#8230;was international trade to a certain extent. And I would say back in 2010, the net trade, meaning the export/import netted out, was roughly about 9% of GDP. And so China's economy was heavily dependent on the global market&#8230;And they were growing really double-digit growth at the time when the rest of the global economy was growing at much, much less, a fraction of that. And so at a certain point, once you become the largest trading nation, you can't really grow, the rest of the world wouldn't be able to keep up. And the other thing that is happening is after the citizens become middle classes, their demand changes from basically just work, saving, into really work and saving and consumption. It's just also human nature.
So roughly around 10 years ago, as you point out, the Chinese economy has slowly evolved into more of a consumer driven economy to the point that interestingly, last year was a watershed year in a sense that the retail sales, the total volume of retail sales for the first time overtaking the United States. China was the largest retail market in the whole world at a $6 trillion. The US was roughly $5.5 trillion. Now grant it that was a special year in the sense that a global pandemic hit other countries harder than China, it's (also said) that China did a better job in managing the pandemic. But basically the trend is there. China is emerging to become the most dynamic, fastest growing consumer market in the whole world, and that is likely to continue for many, many more decades to come. And so that really makes China even more attractive to the global economy in terms of people who want to sell to the consumers, to the middle class in China. And the characteristic of the economy would change and would also really provide unique and interesting opportunities for global investors.",0
845,"Let me just talk a little bit about that. I mean, the thing about retail sales is that it's selling goods. The thing about the developed economies is that they're overwhelmingly service economies, they're not goods economies. And on that dimension, it doesn't look like China's doing particularly well. And as I say, the export data, you could understand that would slowdown, but the fact that the import data has slowed down just as much or more tells you something about the nature of domestic growth in China. What about the challenges in the service sector in China?","Well, you're certainly right that at the current stage, the service sector has yet to become as powerful and dominant as most of the matured and developed economies in the West. And that's really (inaudible) a new set of opportunities for the decades ahead of them. And that's, by the way, not that much different than all the other developed economies at a comparable stage in the development of, say, $10,000, $11,000 per capita GDP, which is where China is today.
But if you look at the underlying dynamics of the various different businesses, different performance, both consumption, retailers and the services are basically the ones that are growing the fastest. And overall, trade internationally is still growing at a robust rate, but not nearly as much as the domestic side of the economy. And so that's why their share of the GDP has gradually began to shrink. So domestic consumption becomes far more important, both goods and the services, as you point out. So that just tells you that a different stage of the economy where it is today.",0
846,So where do you see the unique challenges and opportunities in sort of finding value investment opportunities in China?,"Well, China remains, I think, one of the best market, if you were a value investor. In a sense, the market is still somewhat underdeveloped. The market today is not as representative as the real economy the way, for example, the United States is. And so there's a lot of the development in that regard. And the trading and the investors are still not as mature. And there's still a mentality of fast trading, high turnovers, which actually render some of the companies, again, go through a faster pace of this boom and bust. Again, that usually provides opportunities for those mature patient investors who truly know what they're doing. And also, as you said, in the service sector of the economy when it comes to financial services, is still yet to be developed. And China was really right at this stage in the financial services industry, actually is about to take off in a big way for many reasons. And it just so happens that the Chinese government is quite keen in making macroeconomic policies quite conducive for the development of the financial services industry. And they've begun to open up to the global firms as well in a way that they've never done that before. So all those confluence of factors really make the market that much more attractive today than it was before.",0
847,"Yeah, can I say something about that? Financial services is probably the fifth and sixth largest service sector. The biggest is housing by far. The second biggest is medical care. The third biggest is education. And the fourth and fifth biggest are like wholesale and retail distribution and personal services and then financial services, although in the US it's a little higher than that. What about those sectors in China.",That sector is also growing&#8230;,0
848,"Right, but do you see opportunities in housing&#8230;","Virtually every industry are going through robust growing stage, some more than the others. And even if industry, they're not growing as fast, you can still find interesting companies, values. And I don't have to&#8230;you're the guru for this field. So different people tend to focus on different aspects of the industries and different aspects of the growth profile, some looking at value and high growth companies, some looking for values at moderate growth companies. Some look for value in places that don't grow at all. In fact, they're probably declined and therefore they find even bigger markets. And so if you are a true good investor in that sense, you can find value everywhere. But you will probably be more capable of finding values in dynamically growing economies such as China. They are still growing at multiple times of the matured economy in the West, and there's still enormous amount of inefficiency in this securities market. So that combination of those two really make it enticing.
On top of that one, a whole series of government reform will make those inefficiencies gradually be more efficient. And so that transition offers even more interesting opportunities. So this is a good time for global investors and certainly for U.S. investors as well.",0
849,"Ok, in those terms that as Chinese financial markets are developing. Do you have certain reforms or other things you'd be interested in seeing implemented? You sort of have a top development that you like to see happen in the China financial markets or even in the China economy?","Well in a sense, it's already happening. That's what I mean by the Chinese government regulator has been very keen to develop the Chinese security market. For years and years the Chinese security market is not very representative of China's economy, partially because really the of the IPO rules are based on what they call approval model. You have to go through&#8230;layers of approval process in order to be listed. And so the ones who are listed are the ones who really approved by government, for whatever reason, often not really market driven. Compare with other markets such as the United States, that it is registration based. And so it is market driven. As a result&#8230;the security markets here are quite representative of the true economy. And as the Chinese economy moving from an export import driven economy into more of consumer demand economy, the entrepreneurial companies with market driven dynamics are increasingly playing a larger role. And therefore the financial markets have to reflect the changing dynamics and the Chinese government is determined to reform this IPO process from one of approval process model into one that is much like the United States of registration-based model.
And so we are probably still early in that process. But as that process began to play out, we'll see the financial market become more reflective of the real economy. And the other big changes that is happening is that most of the financing are done through the banking sectors up to the point, 80 plus percent. And over time, the financing is best to really do through what they call &#8216;direct financing', mostly through market driven dynamics of fixed income, equity, etc. And so we see the overall financing model, the Chinese economy, from one that is more indirect, into more direct. And so thus is the reason for opening up this financial service industry, both for domestic players and global players. As we're seeing that dynamic play out over the next decade or so there will be a lot more opportunities and the financial market will become more mature and there will be more institutional players coming into it. And the financial markets will become much, much bigger than what it is today. So those area really all bode well for investors who truly understand what they're doing in China.",0
850,"Now, let me ask another question in that connection. I mean, the thing about a service economy is that services are overwhelmingly locally produced and consumed. There are very few global universities, for example, there are very few global high schools, very few global hospitals. That means that typically if you look at developed economies like the United States with big service sectors, the firms which tend to be local, the service firms that tend to be local, tend to be locally financed. So I assume you know that local banks in the United States are much more profitable than the big global banks. Do you see a comparable trend developing in China that you can take advantage of?",Some yes and some no. I wouldn't say that&#8230;,0
851,"No, I'm just thinking in terms of local experts within China (inaudible) local service businesses, that would include, of course, local banks.","Yeah, well, they tend to really know their local area. But the Chinese regulation in banking is slightly different. So there are only roughly about 15 banks that really have the mandate of being able to take deposit on a national basis. And all the rest of the financial institutions are able to really take deposits in a very, very small, well-defined local region. Whether they're a town, or villages, or the cities, etc. And so it is a heavily, heavily regulated business. And so that really gives them almost an oligopoly type of a status in terms of taking deposit, which is very important and of course, in terms of the source of capital.
So that dynamic is a slightly different than the United States, for example. That the license ability to really be able to open a bank is much, much more relaxed in the United States than in China. As a result, basically the dynamics of the larger national versus local or regional banks and other financial institutions, are more driven by basically the business dynamics and market dynamics. And this is very different than in China. It is driven first and foremost by the regulation regime. And so, that makes the comparison of the banks really quite different in China than the United States.",0
852,So somebody investing in banks in China have to be an expert in Chinese regulation?,Absolutely.,0
853,A specialist?,"Yes. (Inaudible) if you invest anything, I recommend you better become the most knowledgeable specialist on the planet before you really invest and hold it through the ups and downs and the thick and thins. And if you do understand them and they are good, it is far more profitable to hold over the long period of time.",0
854,"Ok, so why don't we talk more broadly about new trends in value investing? So among them many popular and rising technological fields such as 5G, Bitcoin, AI, has any of that attracted your interest as a value investor and why?","Well, as I said, if you're an investor, you really want to find out what really influenced the change of your companies. The one big forces that are really quite prominent is the fast acceleration of technological changes. And of course, you need to be well aware of those mega technological trend. This current wave that started 40, 50 years since the invention of the semiconductor, particularly the integrated circuit, that really ultimately led to personal computer and computational proliferation, the computation power to ordinary citizens. And from there, there's also the evolution of communication technologies and then the invention of the internet somewhere 25, 30 years ago. From there, the mobile internet.
So the intersections of computing as well as the omnipresent and instantaneous communication really led to this new phenomena of artificial intelligence and the data economy as a result of it. And so this wave of technological change over the last 40 years has fundamentally altered the business landscape of all kinds, basically. And so whatever kind of investor you are, we do need to be aware of these huge changes. And how do you deal with that in a sense? Well you're investing in businesses that are either well insulated from those technological change or in companies whose management team is quite capable of adapting to those technological changes better than their competitors. Or in companies that are leading those changes or enabling changes so that those changes are really on your side. And so, now do you have to be a true expert to the point of an engineer? I don't think you do, but you do need to be broadly aware of all of us have big technology changes. Now, if you happen to be a venture capitalist in those fields then of course you do, but if you're a generalist and study all the businesses, you need to be aware of those trends. How does it really impact in the industry, in the companies that you're invested in? So we are still really in the middle of that gigantic wave that started with the invention of the semiconductor.",0
855,"By the way, do you know when the transistor was invented?","Well, that's a longer I know that.",0
856,And the first (integrated circuit) was 1961.,"Yes, yes. You're referring to the time (technology) really gets integrated into industry. So that really started this whole revolution that we're actually still in the middle of it. And the current wave of neural network based artificial intelligence is just kind of the recent iteration. And the data economy that as a result of it is the newest adaptation by industries in response to that new technology. We're going to see more of it as time evolves from here.",0
857,"Do you see opportunities to invest in new technologies? Do you have an example, maybe in your past where you did invest successfully in a new technology?","We have, in a sense, back in the days I was trying to learn about businesses, I invested in a number of startups. And so I am fascinated about the technologies. And today we have somewhat smaller exposure to that. But it is fascinating. It's not really that (I'm) not interested in technology. It's just that it's not that easy to predict their impact because of the pace of change. It does require a different aptitude, different domain expertise, etc. The other things is we chose to have other set of easier opportunities. We just happened to be lucky.",0
858,"All right. So let's talk about a specific example. A lot of smart people believe that renewable energy is the next big revolution. And you've done a lot of work on battery technology and BYD. So is that something that you think about beyond batteries? What's your outlook for the electrical vehicle industry say in the next five years, or is it overheated now? Where is Tesla going?","So the car industry is simultaneously kind of being impacted by you know, four or five big megatrends. Electrification, ride sharing, autonomous driving, and the intelligent design. All of those really going into the industry simultaneously. And so that really attracted more entrants and that really heated the competition. Also, against the broad background of climate change, the carbon neutral revolution in the sense. So as a result of the industry that really has last for 100 years is really being turned upside down. On the other side, it is a gigantic industry. So other than housing, that's probably one of the biggest industry. So the prize is also in the end. In the process though, the competition is going to become very, very intense. Still it does still have that characteristic of being a scale economy, as we talked about it in the beginning of our dialogue. So the survivors or the winners do need to have a certain scale in order to be able to win in the end. So it is still early to predict who will be the ultimate winner, but it is not early at all to predict those mega trends are here to stay. 
So five years there will be far more electric cars sold. We have seen the European countries began to declare a deadline to stop basically gasoline powered cars. China is following that up, I think, in due course. And we are going to see those megatrends here to stay. And five years from now, that trend will become even more prominent than what it is today. But it is very difficult to predict the ultimate winner&#8230;and it continues to attract new entrants at this point. But I do think that the ones that really possess unique technology, have the scale, and have the right strategic focus ultimately will do well.",0
859,Do you have a sense of which companies will do well?,"Well I bet once. So I let my money speaker for itself. But we're not going to be the only ones, there will be a few. It is a gigantic industry.",0
860,"Ok, so in terms of value investing education, you actually played a big role in promoting and advocating value investing from the books to actually you underwrote this class that we talked about where I went to Peking University and I think it still survives. What's your vision for the kind of education that a new investor should embrace and where that education might be available?","Well, first of all, thank you Bruce for coming to teach at the Peking University value investing classes that my colleague Jing Chang and I started six years ago. And now it's six year and it's still running and running very well. And you have played an important role to that. And I think our original inspiration for that class was really based on pretty much your class and your class was pretty much inspired and a continuation of Ben Graham's class&#8230;Graham and Dodd, which had, among others, Warren Buffett as a student. And I'm your student. (There'll) be many more much brighter investors coming after us. And that's a good thing. So we're trying to really do our part to pass on both the philosophy, the thinking, and the practical art of investing to the next generation, in a sense. So in terms of the younger students when you start today. So I think a few things will be important. When I talk to young students and people who started out trying to get into the field, I say several things that are important.
&#8216;A' to always adopt an owners mentality. And so I like to really ask a student or analyst at our firm basically to imagine that all of a sudden that one of your unknown uncles died and handed over 100% ownership of the company to you. And that's the business you were going to study. So any company, think starting point that way. And once you really kind of think you own 100 percent of it, your mentality is totally different. So you never know that business existed, now you own 100%. You have no idea how to run it. You don't know the people who run it. What do you do? You want to know everything, everything you can possibly get your hands on.
And a lot of the things you know, you don't really understand. You just know the facts. You don't understand it. But that's OK. You're going to continue to learn until you get a handle of it. And even if then because of the constant change, you're going to continue to evolve your knowledge of it. Now, if you adopt that mentality, study any businesses, you have really started the process of becoming a real value investor. So that's the first thing.
The second thing is you really want to maintain intellectual honesty. And that is very, very important. You have to be really honest about what you know, what you assume&#8230;what you pretend&#8230;subconsciously&#8230;and what you don't know. How do you know that? One of the things that Charlie has talked about that I think makes the most sense is, (he's) said that &#8220;I'm never entitled to have a view until I can find the smartest people on the planet who took the other side of that view and I can argue better the opposition than he does. When I can do that, I would be entitled to have a view.&#8221; The same thing applies to investing in a sense. That intellectual honesty is a good life philosophy to begin with. It is critical. It is vital when it comes to investment. Because, as I said, the security market almost exists to really find your weaknesses, your dishonesty, your pretension, your mushy knowledges. And if you do not really possess that fundamental attitude of intellectual honesty, you'll get destroyed at some point during your career by the financial market. It was almost designed that way to catch you.",0
861,"Can I say something about that? Because it is better than designed that way. Every time you buy a security thinking it's going to do well, somebody else is selling you that security, thinking it's going to do badly, and vice versa. And one of you is always wrong. So you better be sure that you're the one that's on the right side of that transaction.","Well, there is some zero-sum aspect, but not always.",0
862,Oh no! It's 100% zero sum. The average return to all investors in any asset class and therefore in all those asset classes is the average return to all those assets.,"Hey Bruce, I take a slightly different view. But I'm never going to argue against my professor, so let's just agree to disagree on that point.",0
863,Ok. That's fair. Keep going.,"That is a fair point. Fair point. And another thing I want to say is that you want to really devote as much time as possible to study of the history of  businesses and the history of great businessmen in the past. The more you study more companies, the better you are when it comes to judgment on good opportunities and the judgment about the fundamental characteristic of the company you're interested in. And so I say all three things are important. To start with the 100% owner mentality, to continue to train yourself, to have a high degree of intellectual honesty. And lastly, to be a very thorough student of the history of the businesses. All three things are really going to be very helpful if you are beginning to get into the field of investment or really want to improve your game. So that's my advice to your students.",0
864,"Good advice. I'm not going to argue with that. When you look back over your own career. Are there things that, whether at Columbia Business School or in your career since then, you would have done differently that would have helped you get to where you are today sort of more quickly and more easily?","Yeah, well looking back I feel I'm extraordinarily lucky and I feel nothing but gratitude. I feel lucky to accidentally step into Buffett's lecture at your class, basically. The first time he came. I feel extraordinarily lucky that I got into the business and to strike a relationship with Charlie Munger. I feel extraordinarily fortunate to live in a period of time when both the United States and China are going through a fundamental economic growth and providing enormous amount of opportunity and that I happen to really know both markets well. And so looking back at my career, nothing I regret. I feel nothing but really gratitude. But in terms on the transition from U.S. to China. I think a lot of people, myself included, went through a period of time to really try to understand the nature of the Chinese economy and the nature of the Chinese market, the nature of the Chinese company&#8230;investment in Chinese companies.
So one of the key learnings that I have, and it is not that obvious, is the role that the Chinese government played in that whole equation. If you have been successful investor in the United States, for example, or in the developed market, you tend to come with a set of assumptions about the role of the government and the role of the market participants. And when you really look into the Chinese market, that assumptions, you will see a lot of challenges.
And so you might really, from time to time, arrive to views that are inconsistent with your own experiences, partially because historically the Chinese government and the U.S. Government, Western governments, perform very different roles. And that's one of the key aspect of really investing in China that really requires much deeper understanding and also a systematic comparison to get rid of those biases. And that's why that you could really get rid of this typical global investor (inaudible) fear or enthusiasm or basically pessimistic kind of &#8216;coming collapse of a China' type of mentality when things are not going to at all. And so that is the education of most of the international investors, particularly when it comes to China that they have to go through. And that is important. But bearing in mind the other aspect to understand to the Chinese economy is that the nature of the modern economy is its ability to generate sustained, compounded economic growth, something that is only recently emerged as the human phenomena. And this is where we talk about the zero-sum versus win-win type of mentality.
Now for the longest period of time that almost all natural or human affairs are characterized by cycles in the sense that everything goes up cycles. You know, we're born and then we grow old, and we die, or the trees it goes up and they die. So entropy basically, is always increased. Energy goes from hot to cold things. From order to disorder. Great businesses eventually loses its edge. So that is the nature of things. And economy goes from boom and bust.
But something unique happened over several hundred years ago with the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. We began to see this phenomenon of continued, sustained, compounded economic growth. And that is really when value investing become very important. And that's why you begin to have a phenomenal record such as the one produced by Warren Buffett and now by a few other people as well. The basic logic behind that, as I said, over the long term, your investment returns are likely to approximate the actual business returns of the company you've invested in. And so the fact that you were capable of generating that long term results is a reflection of a changing nature of the economy. What really drives that phenomenon is something that is utterly fascinating. I literally spent 30, 40 years thinking about that. Until I think I come to a certain knowledge, I wouldn't say really know it all, but I think what really produced in that phenomena is, is a combination of free market enterprise, way of organizing social economic affairs. And combine that one with the invention of modern science and technology, a combination of those two produced a modern form of economy. And it's a paradigm shift.
So what has happened in China is that roughly around 40 years ago, China has really stumbled finally into that magic formula of free market economy. Now, with Chinese characteristic, of course, along with modern science and technology. And any economy that has really strike that magic formula, begins to produce the phenomenon of compounding economic performance. Now that has to be combined with the stability of overall political environment to allow the market force that a new economy to really release that power. And that is when a sustained investment record can be possible in China. It's not always there, it's not always possible. And often it was a zero sum. But I think from that period on, that a sustained win-win type of a compounded investment return becomes possible. And notice that I didn't really include the political component of it. Most of the Western observers believe that political democracy has to be part of the equation, except they forgot that political democracy wasn't there when that phenomenon began to take place in the West. In fact, the political democracy happened later, almost as a result, but not because of it. Anyways, so that is another layer of understanding the phenomena of investment opportunities in China that could be interesting.",0
865,"Ok, so what about, let's just talk briefly in these last eight or so minutes about your personal interest. So you've devoted efforts to improving equality and welfare for Asian-Americans. And given the recent elevated attention on this community, what are you doing and planning to do or you think ought to be done for that community?","Well, I was really, like many people around the Asian-American community in America, just utterly dismayed, heartbroken over the last year and a half. Particularly since the later years of the Trump administration, it got worsened because of the pandemic, this new wave of anti-Asian hate crimes. And by all statistics that instance of racial discrimination against Asian-Americans has dramatically increased over the last year and a half. For a variety of different reasons. The pandemic, the Trump policies, the U.S./China tension, and the systematic historical root. Suffice to say that many people in Asian-American community are living in fears, literally physical fears today after being here for so many years, of being such an important part of the American experiment. Particularly to the Chinese American community. After 150 years, it feels like the Chinese Exclusion Act has come back again. And so I have been thinking long and hard at what can we do to change the paradigm? Now I had a different experiences when I came to America. I had a wonderful, wonderful experiences. America embraced me with open, warm heart. And I have gotten an enormous amount of opportunities like Columbia University and all the great people I met along the way. And the opportunity I was given to be successful way beyond my wildest dreams when I first came here as an immigrant. Not a penny and nobody to speak the language, to be where I am today.
And so one thing that I always believed about America is this. I think America is not defined by geography. It is not defined by race. It is not defined by a culture. Not defined by religion. America is defined by a set of ideas and ideals. Anyone, no matter your race, religion, culture, background, if you sign up to that set of ideas, ideals, can be America. I was one of those who believe in those ideas and ideals that became a successful American. And I want that experiment to really continue. And obviously, when you look at history, it was never a perfect experiment. In that it was often marked by the (inaudible), and sometimes actually outright cruel, malicious, if you think about it, experiences with the African Americans and all the other minorities. But I think America remains the only country on Earth, so inspired and such constructed. And for that experiment to continue, it calls constantly to our better angels inside each one of us. And to really restrict the worst instincts of all of us. And throughout a different period of time, people need to rise up to counter those worst instinct and fight them and face them down.
And this is one of those periods again. So I think the entire community of Asian-Americans have to come together. The entire American community need to really come together to really fight this wave of Anti-Asian discrimination. So along with a number of wonderful colleagues, we are cofounding a new national organization whose mission is to serve Asian-Americans in their pursuit of belonging and prosperity. Free from discrimination, slander or violence. And one of the things that our (inaudible) needs is, an enormous amount of funding. The statistics tell us that only 0.2% of all philanthropy in America goes to Asian-American causes. And we want to fundamentally change that. And hopefully with this new organization, new group of people, we really want to fundamentally change that picture.
And the other thing is that with the global economy, the center of the global economy shifting from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean, Asian American, 20 million strong are going to play an increasingly important role to position America as the new Pacific economic power. And that group of people more than other ones, if fully integrated as the very fabric of American society, could help lead America to better integrated with the better economic ties in Asia.",0
